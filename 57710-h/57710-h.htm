<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>CHAPTER
I.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> round white September moon
lighted up Pitfield Street from end to end, making the gas lights
in the shop windows look abashed and unnecessary; out in the Old
Street triangle, men on the wooden seats who had good eyesight
read halfpenny evening papers as though it were day, able without
trouble to make record in knowing-looking pocket-books of the
running of Ormonde.&nbsp; At the Hoxton Theatre of Varieties, the
early crowd streamed out into Pitfield Street flushed with two
hours of joy for twopence, and the late crowd which had been
waiting patiently for some time at the doors, flowed in.&nbsp;
When these two crowds had disappeared, the Old Street end of
Pitfield Street belonged once more to the men and women who were
shopping, and at the obtrusive fruiterer&rsquo;s (with a shop
that bulged almost to the kerb and a wife whose size was really
beyond all reason), even there one could just pass without
stepping into the road.&nbsp; Further up the street, outside a
public-house, was, however, another crowd blocking the pathway,
and this crowd overflowed into the dim passage by the side of the
public-house, where it looked up at a lighted room on the first
floor with an interest ungenerously repaid by the back view of a
few heads.&nbsp; A grown-up crowd, mainly of middle-aged
women.&nbsp; Children had given up efforts to belong to it, and
down the passage, which was as the neck of a bottle leading into
a court quite six feet wide, youngsters shouted and sang and
quarrelled and played at games.&nbsp; From the direction of the
other end came a short acute-faced boy with a peakless cap, a
worn red scarf tied very tightly around his neck.&nbsp; He had
both hands in the pockets of a jacket which was too large for
him; he smoked the fag-end of a cigar with the frowning air of a
connoisseur who is not altogether well pleased with the
brand.&nbsp; He stopped, signalled with a jerk of his head to a
slip of a girl who was disputing for the possession of an empty
lobster can, with the vigour that could not have been exceeded if
the lobster can had been a jewel case of priceless value; she
retired at once from the struggle, and, pulling at her stocking,
ran towards him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s all the chaps?&rdquo; he asked, removing
the cigar stump from his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;ve you bin, Bobbie Lancaster?&rdquo; she
asked, without replying to his question.</p>
<p><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>&ldquo;You &rsquo;eard what I asted you, Trix,&rdquo; he
said, steadily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I asted you where all the chaps
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of &rsquo;em have gone over &rsquo;Ackney
way,&rdquo; said the slip of a girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where&rsquo;ve
you bin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flicked the black ash from the fag end in the manner of one
five times his age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Opping!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a liar!&rdquo; retorted the small girl,
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; said the boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shows what you
know about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but,&rdquo; she said, admiringly, &ldquo;&rsquo;ave
you though, straight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve bin at Yaldin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said, with
immeasurable importance,&mdash;&ldquo;at Yaldin&rsquo; down in
Kent for ite days.&nbsp; Me and another chap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bin &rsquo;ome?&rdquo; asked the girl, with
interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;When I do I shall
&rsquo;ave to take a drop of something in for the old gel.&nbsp;
I went off wifout letting her know and I expect she&rsquo;s been
wonderin&rsquo; what&rsquo;s become of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if you ain&rsquo;t bin &rsquo;ome,&rdquo; said the
little girl, breathlessly, &ldquo;p&rsquo;raps you
don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A strong voice called from a doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trixie Bell!&nbsp; Trixie Bell!&nbsp; You come in this
minute and look after the shop, you good-for-nothing little
terror.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must be off,&rdquo; said the small girl, going
hurriedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wait &rsquo;ere till I come out again and
I&rsquo;ll tell you somefing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t waste my time loafin&rsquo; about for
gels,&rdquo; said Master Lancaster, as the girl disappeared in a
doorway.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ketch me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sauntered down the court towards Pitfield Street and,
noting the crowd, slightly increased his pace.&nbsp; Taking a
shilling from his coat pocket he tied it in a blue handkerchief
and stuffed the handkerchief inside his waistcoat, being aware
apparently that it is in a London crowd that property sometimes
changes hands in the most astonishing manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well then,&rdquo; said a fiery faced woman, who,
getting the worst of an argument, was looking around for another
subject, &ldquo;if you did &rsquo;ave an uncle who was drowned,
that&rsquo;s no reason why you should step on this little
kid&rsquo;s toes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Born clumsy!&rdquo; agreed Master Lancaster,
resentfully rubbing his boot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand a bit aside, can&rsquo;t you, and let the
youngster pass.&nbsp; &rsquo;Aving a uncle who was in the navy
don&rsquo;t entitle you to take up all the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Likely as not the little beggar&rsquo;s a witness and
wants to go upstairs.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fiery faced woman looked
down at the boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you a witness, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course I&rsquo;m a witness,&rdquo; he said,
readily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; exclaimed the beefy faced
woman with triumph.&nbsp; &ldquo;Constable, &rsquo;ere &rsquo;s a
witness that &rsquo;s got to be got upstairs.&nbsp; Make way for
him, else he&rsquo;ll get hisself in a row for being
late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon, to his great amazement and satisfaction, Master
Bobbie Lancaster found himself passed along through the thick
crowd of matrons to the swing doors of the public-house; the
importance of his mission being added to by every lady, so that
when at last he reached the two policemen guarding the stairs he
was introduced to them as a boy who saw the accident; could
identify the driver, could, in short, clear up everything.&nbsp;
Bobbie, accordingly, after being cuffed by the two policemen
(more from force of habit than any desire to treat him harshly),
was shot up the staircase past a window where, glancing aside, he
saw the bunches of excited interested faces below; past a
landing, and, the door being left momentarily unattended, he
slipped into the room.&nbsp; He gave up instantly his newly
gained character and crouched modestly in a corner behind the
thirty members of the general public and kept his head well
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now, now!&nbsp; Do let &rsquo;s proceed in
order.&nbsp; Is there any other witness who can throw any light
on the affair?&nbsp; What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The club room of the public-house, with cider and whiskey
advertisements on its brown papered walls, was long and narrow,
and the stout genial man seated at the end of the table had
command of the room from his position.&nbsp; He gave his orders
to a bare-headed sergeant who hunted for witnesses and submitted
the results at the other end of the long table; he smiled when he
turned to the twelve moody gentlemen at the side of the table; to
one, at the extreme end, who had a carpenter&rsquo;s rule in his
breast pocket he was especially courteous.&nbsp; The carpenter
made laborious notes with a flat lead pencil on a slip of blue
paper, a proceeding at which the other members of the jury
grunted disdainfully.&nbsp; Bobbie Lancaster, between the arms of
two men in front of him, caught sight momentarily of the woman
whom the sergeant had caught and who was now kissing the
Testament.&nbsp; He recognised her as a neighbour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does she say her name is, sergeant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Jane Rastin, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Jane Rastin.&rdquo;&nbsp; The coroner wrote the
name.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very good!&nbsp; Now, Mrs.
Rastin&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Alf a minute,&rdquo; interrupted the
carpenter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me get this down right.&nbsp;
W&mdash;r&mdash;a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;W be blowed,&rdquo; said the blowsy woman at the end of
the table indignantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know how to
spell a simple name like Rastin?&nbsp; Very clear you was before
the days of the School Board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it down,&rdquo; said the coroner, suavely,
&ldquo;R&mdash;a&mdash;s&mdash;t&mdash;i&mdash;n.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rastin, in complimentary tones,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re a gentleman, sir.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve had an
education.&nbsp; You ain&rsquo;t been dragged up
like&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful what you&rsquo;re saying of,&rdquo; begged
the carpenter, fiercely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go
aspersing my character, if you please.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m setting
&rsquo;ere now to represent the for and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now, my dear sir,&rdquo; said the coroner,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t quarrel with the witness.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
smiled cheerfully at the other members of the jury and almost
winked.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my prerogative, you
know.&rdquo;&nbsp; He turned to the trembling lady at the end of
the table.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, Mrs. Rastin, you live in Pimlico
Walk, and you are, I believe, a widow?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Rastin
bowed severely, and then looked at the carpenter as who should
say, What do you make of that, my fine fellow?&nbsp; The coroner
went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you knew the deceased?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Intimate, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she a woman with&mdash;er, inebriate
tendencies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say was she a woman who had a weakness for
alcohol?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sergeant interpreted, &ldquo;Did she booze?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She liked her glass now and again, sir,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Rastin, carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is rather vague,&rdquo; remarked the
coroner.&nbsp; &ldquo;What does &rsquo;now and again&rsquo;
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rastin, tying the ribbons
of her rusty bonnet into a desperate knot, &ldquo;what I mean to
say is whenever she had the chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>&ldquo;You were with her before the accident?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I were!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had been drinking together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rastin, impartially, and
untying her bonnet-strings, &ldquo;scarcely what you&rsquo;d call
drinking.&nbsp; It was like this.&nbsp; It were the anniversary
of my weddin&rsquo; day, and, brute as Rastin always was, and
shameful as he treated all my rel&rsquo;tives in the way of
borrowin&rsquo;, still it&rsquo;s an occasion that comes, as I
say, only once a year, and it seems wicked not to take a little
something special, if it&rsquo;s only a drop of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after you had been together some time, you walked
along Haberdasher Street to East Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the view, sir,&rdquo; explained Mrs. Rastin,
&ldquo;of &rsquo;aving a breath of fresh air before turning
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was the deceased the worse for drink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, sir!&nbsp; No, nothing of the
kind.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Rastin was quite emphatic.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She felt much the better for it.&nbsp; She said
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A corroborative murmur came from the crowd behind which Bobbie
was hiding; one of the endorsements sounded so much like the
tones of his mother that he edged a little further away.&nbsp; He
had become interested in the proceedings, and after the great
good fortune of getting into the room, he did not want to be
expelled by an indignant parent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was it you did not see the omnibus coming
along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just one query I should like to ask first,&rdquo;
interposed the carpenter, holding up his left hand with a dim
remembrance of school etiquette.&nbsp; &ldquo;What time was all
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six o&rsquo;clock, as near as I can remember,&rdquo;
snapped Mrs. Rastin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six o&rsquo;clock in the morning?&rdquo; asked the
carpenter, writing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, pudden head,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rastin,
contemptuously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Six o&rsquo;clock in the
evening.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you buy a new pair of ears and
give another twopence this time and get a good&mdash;All right,
sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; To the coroner.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll answer
your question with pleasure.&nbsp; I know when I&rsquo;m speaking
to gentlemen, and I know when I&rsquo;m talking to
pigs.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Rastin glanced triumphantly at the
carpenter, and the carpenter looked appealingly at his
unsympathetic colleagues in search of support.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
was standing on the kerb as I might be &rsquo;ere.&nbsp; Over
there, as it might be, where the young man in glasses is
that&rsquo;s connected with the newspaper, was a barrer with
sweetstuff.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; she says all at once,
&lsquo;I must get some toffee,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;for my
little boy &rsquo;gainst he comes &rsquo;ome,&rsquo; she
says.&nbsp; With that, and before I could so much as open me
mouth to say &lsquo;Mind out!&rsquo; the poor deer was &rsquo;alf
way across the road; the &rsquo;bus was on her and down she
went.&nbsp; I cuts across to her&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Rastin wept,
and Bobbie could hear responsive sobs from the women near
him&mdash;&ldquo;I cuts across to her, and she says.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&mdash;I never got the sweets for him,&rsquo; she
says.&nbsp; Thinking of her&mdash;of her little boy right at the
last; you understand me, sir!&nbsp; And the constable off with
his cape and put it under her &rsquo;ead, and she just turned,
and,&rdquo; Mrs. Rastin wept bitterly, &ldquo;and it was all
over.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Rastin patted her eyes with a deplorable
handkerchief.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;I
never got them sweets&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me!&rdquo; said the carpenter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did
you make a note of them words at the time?&nbsp; What I mean to
say is, did you write &rsquo;em down on paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not being,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rastin, swallowing, her
head shivering with <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>contempt, and speaking with great elaboration, &ldquo;not
being a clever juggins with a miserable twopenny &rsquo;apenny
business as joiner and carpenter in &rsquo;Oxton Street, and
paying about a penny in the pound, if that, I did not write them
words down on paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; said the carpenter, defiantly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then you ought to &rsquo;ave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Rastin was allowed to back from the end of the table and
to take a privileged seat on a form where she had for company the
witnesses who had already given evidence.&nbsp; These were an
anxious &rsquo;bus driver, a constable of the G Division, and a
young doctor from the hospital.&nbsp; The sergeant went hunting
again in the crowd, and this time captured what appeared to be a
small girl, but proved to be a tiny specimen of a mature
woman.&nbsp; Bobbie Lancaster, dodging to get a sight of her,
chuckled as he recognized Miss Threepenny (so called from some
fancied resemblance to that miniature coin), a little person whom
he had not infrequently derided and chased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know that we want any more
evidence, sergeant,&rdquo; remarked the coroner.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What do you say, gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleven of the gentlemen replied that they had had ample; the
carpenter waited until they had stated this, and then decided
that the little woman&rsquo;s evidence should be heard.&nbsp;
Miss Threepenny, stepping on tiptoe, her hands folded on the
handle of a rib-broken umbrella that was for her absurdly long,
explained that she saw the accident, being then on her way home
from her work at a theatrical costumier&rsquo;s in Tabernacle
Street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was on the point of crossing the road, your
worship,&rdquo; said the tiny woman in her shrill voice,
&ldquo;jest &rsquo;esitatin&rsquo; on the kerb, when I see the
&rsquo;bus coming along, and I says to myself, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
wait till this great &rsquo;ulking thing goes by,&rsquo; I says,
&lsquo;and then I&rsquo;ll pop across.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
thought,&rdquo; said Miss Threepenny, dramatically, &ldquo;had no
sooner entered my mind than across the road runs the poor
creature, under the &rsquo;orses&rsquo; &rsquo;eels she goes, and
I,&mdash;well, I went off into a dead faint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mite of a creature looked round the room as though
anticipating commendation for her appropriate behaviour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you agree with the other witnesses, my good little
girl, that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; interrupted Miss Threepenny, with
great dignity, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a good little girl; I&rsquo;m
a grown-up woman of thirty-three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty what?&rdquo; asked the carpenter, his pencil
ready to record facts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty-three,&rdquo; she repeated, sharply.</p>
<p>A confirmatory murmur came from the crowd of women at the back
of the room.&nbsp; The sergeant told the women to be quiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mistake,&rdquo; said the coroner, politely, and
waving aside the incredulous carpenter.&nbsp; &ldquo;The point
is&mdash;you think it was an accident, don&rsquo;t you,
madam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It were an accident,&rdquo; said Miss Threepenny,
looking round and fixing the nervous &rsquo;bus driver with her
bright, black little eyes, &ldquo;that would never have happened
if drivers on &rsquo;busses was to attend to their business
instead of having their heads turned and carrying on conversation
with long silly overgrown gels riding on the front
seat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little woman, having made this statement, kissed the
Testament again as though to make doubly sure, and, with an air
of dignity that no full-grown woman would ever have dared to
assume, trotted off to take her seat next the &rsquo;bus
driver.&nbsp; On the &rsquo;bus driver whispering something
viciously behind his hand, Miss Threepenny replied with perfect
calm in an <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>audible voice that it was no use the &rsquo;bus driver
flirting with her, for she was a strict Wesleyan.</p>
<p>The carpenter&rsquo;s obstinacy necessitated the clearing of
the court now that the time had arrived for the jury to consider
their verdict, and Master Lancaster, much to his annoyance, found
himself borne out of the room in the middle of the crowd of
women.&nbsp; He doubted the probability of getting back into the
room to hear the verdict, because it seemed scarce likely that he
would again have the good luck to slip in unobserved by the
policeman at the door.&nbsp; He went to the first landing and
looked out on the upturned faces in the court below.&nbsp; A long
youth with pince-nez, who had been taking notes upstairs, came
down, and, in opening an evening paper, brushed unintentionally
against Bobbie&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my dial,&rdquo; said the boy, truculently,
&ldquo;when you&rsquo;ve done with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; said the young reporter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re clumsy,&rdquo; said Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing at an affair of this
kind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answerin&rsquo; silly questions what are put to
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; The reporter laughed, and, striking a match,
lighted a cigarette.&nbsp; &ldquo;After you,&rdquo; said Bobbie,
producing another fag-end of a cigar, &ldquo;after you with the
match.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like smoking?&rdquo; asked the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfect slive to it,&rdquo; said the boy, puffing the
smoke well away in a manner that belied the assertion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer little beggar!&rdquo; said the young man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where d&rsquo;you live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ome!&rdquo; said the boy, promptly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where d&rsquo;you think, cloth-head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strictly speaking,&rdquo; remarked the youth, with good
humour, &ldquo;my name is not cloth-head.&nbsp; My name is
Myddleton West.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you sleep a-nights?&rdquo; asked the boy,
&ldquo;with a name like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Myddleton West, journalist, of 39, Fetter Lane,
Holborn.&nbsp; Now tell me yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy complied reluctantly.&nbsp; With decreasing hesitation
he gave further particulars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do a sketch about you,&rdquo; said Myddleton
West, looking down at the boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;The Infant of
Hoxton&rsquo; I think I&rsquo;ll call it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to put some&rsquo;ing about me in the
paper?&rdquo; asked the boy, with undisguised interest, and
discarding entirely his attitude of defiance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;ll take it.&nbsp; There is at times a
certain coyness on the part of editors&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy suddenly started.&nbsp; He touched the brass rod, and
flew downstairs with so much swiftness that he reached the court
before Myddleton West had discovered his absence.&nbsp; West
looked up and saw the constable descending to call him back to
the room; the reason for Bobbie Lancaster&rsquo;s flight became
obvious.</p>
<p>The boy slipped eel-like through the crowd of women at the
doorway, and presently reached moonlight and Hoxton Street, where
he drifted intuitively to the outside of the theatre.&nbsp; It
gratified him exceedingly as he felt the shilling in his knotted
handkerchief, to think that he might, if he were so
minded&mdash;the hour being now half-past eight&mdash;go in at
half price, and seating himself in the stage box, witness the
last three acts of &ldquo;Foiled by a Woman.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
laughed outright as, standing near the lamps, he looked in at the
swing doors of the principal entrance and imagined the
astonishment of those in the three-penny gallery, high up on the
top of the mountain of faces within, were they to see him enter
importantly <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>the box at the right of the stage and survey with lordly
air the crowded, heated, interested house.&nbsp; How they would
roar at him if he were to stick a penny in his eye and, carefully
stroking an imaginary moustache, say, &ldquo;Bai Jove!&nbsp; What
people!&rdquo;&nbsp; It would not be the first time that he had
amused a crowd; once at a fire in Shoreditch he had put on a
paper helmet, pretending to be chief of the fire brigade, and a
matron in the crowd, watching him, had been so exceptionally
amused at his antics that she had had to be unlaced and dragged
home by solicitous lady friends.&nbsp; The boy resisted the
temptations of the enticing placards, for he had already decided
on the manner in which the shilling was to be expended; the
recollection of this made him think of home.&nbsp; There would be
some argument, he knew, with his mother concerning his long
absence, but, once the first storm was over, sunshine would come,
and a small flask and sausages would make her content.</p>
<p>He stepped in at the dark open doorway of his home, and went
upstairs.&nbsp; At the end of the passage on the ground floor a
smelly oil lamp diffused scent, but not light; it served only to
accentuate the blackness.&nbsp; The boy knew the stairs well, and
dodging the hole on the fifth stair and stepping over the
eighth&mdash;the eighth was a practical joke stair, and if you
stepped on its edge it instantly stood up and knocked your
leg&mdash;he piloted himself adroitly on the landing.&nbsp; There
were voices in the back room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comp&rsquo;ny!&rdquo; said Bobbie.&nbsp; &ldquo;So much
the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pushed the door and entered.&nbsp; Two women in a corner,
examining the contents of a crippled chest of drawers by the aid
of a candle, looked affrightedly over their shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ullo!&rdquo; said Bobbie.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
your little game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You give us quite a turn, Bobbie,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Rastin nervously, &ldquo;coming in so quiet.&nbsp; Where
&rsquo;ave you bin all this time, deer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the old gel?&rdquo; asked Bobbie, taking
his parcels from his pocket.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s she got
to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Eaven,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rastin&rsquo;s friend,
trying to close the drawer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to be funny,&rdquo; advised the boy,
&ldquo;you can&rsquo;t do it well, and you&rsquo;d better be
&rsquo;alf leave it alone.&nbsp; How long &rsquo;fore
she&rsquo;ll be in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You &rsquo;aven&rsquo;t &rsquo;eard, deer,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Rastin, coming forward and taking the flask from him
absently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your poor mother&rsquo;s bin run over and
we&rsquo;ve jest bin &rsquo;olding her inquest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobbie Lancaster sat down on the wooden chair and blinked
stupidly at the two women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was that&mdash;was that my old gel that you give
evidence about jest now up at the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Bobbie.&nbsp; That was your poor dear mother, and
a lovinger heart never breathed.&nbsp; Not in this world at any
rate.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Rastin uncorked the flask and sniffed at
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you must cheer up, you know, because it was
to be, and all flesh is grass, and we shall meet, please
God&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Rastin took a sip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s many a kid,&rdquo; chimed in the
other neighbour, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just as bad off as you, my
lad, losing both their parents, and you mustn&rsquo;t think
you&rsquo;re the only one, ye know.&nbsp; You want a glass, Mrs.
Rastin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy did not cry.&nbsp; His mouth twitched slightly, and he
frowned as though endeavouring to understand clearly the position
of affairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old man died,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;soon after
I was born, and now the old gel&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>&ldquo;Yes, Bobby!&nbsp; Run and get a lump of sugar,
Mrs. What-is-it, out of my caddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;it &rsquo;mounts to
this.&nbsp; I ain&rsquo;t got no fawther and I ain&rsquo;t got no
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about it, Bobbie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy jerked his chin and commenced to unlace his boots
rather fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dem bright look out for me,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> boy&rsquo;s sense of injury
gave way, and became, indeed, utterly routed the next morning by
a feeling of importance.&nbsp; Mrs. Rastin bustled in and
prepared a breakfast that filled the room with a most entrancing
scent of frying fish; to show her sympathy she sat down with him
to the meal, and ate with excellent appetite, beguiling the time
with cheery accounts of sudden deaths and murders and suicides
that she, in the past, had had the rare good fortune to
encounter.&nbsp; Mrs. Rastin took charge of the keys belonging to
the chest of drawers, remarking that so far as regarded any
little thing that Bobbie&rsquo;s poor dear mother might have
left, she would see that right was done just the same as though
it were her own.&nbsp; Holidays being on at the Board School
which Bobbie intermittently attended, Mrs. Rastin said how would
it be if he were to take a turn in Hoxton Street for a few hours
whilst she turned to and tidied up?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jest as you like,&rdquo; said Bobbie agreeably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go and get into no mischief,
mind,&rdquo; counselled Mr. Rastin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep away from that Shoreditch set, and take good care
of yourself.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re all alone in the world
now,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rastin, pouring the last drop from the
teapot into her cup, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave to look
out.&nbsp; You &rsquo;ain&rsquo;t got no mother to &rsquo;elp
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By-the-bye,&rdquo; said Bobbie, &ldquo;who&rsquo;s
going to cash up for putting the old woman away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me and a few neighbours are going to see to it,&rdquo;
remarked the lady with reserve.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
bother your &rsquo;ead about that.&nbsp; Run off and&mdash;Just a
minute, I&rsquo;ll sew this black band round the sleeve of your
coat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whaffor?&rdquo; asked the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, bless my soul!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Rastin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;As a sign that you&rsquo;re sorry, of course.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the idea, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave to buy you a collar, too,
for Tuesday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me in a collar?&rdquo; he said gratified.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My word, I shall be a reg&rsquo;lar toff, if I ain&rsquo;t
careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What size&mdash;I think that&rsquo;ll hold&mdash;what
size do you take, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord knows,&rdquo; said the boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never wore one yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If in Hoxton that day a more conceited boy than Robert
Lancaster had been in request, the discovery would have been
difficult.&nbsp; He strolled up <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>and down Hoxton Street, where the
second-hand furniture dealers place bedsteads brazenly in the
roadway, and when shop people, standing at their doors, glanced
at the crape band on his sleeve he stood still for a while in
order that they might have a good view.</p>
<p>A good-natured Jewess in charge of a fruit stall called to him
and inquired the nature of his loss, and on Bobbie supplying the
facts (adding to the interest by various details suggested by his
imagination) the Jewess gave an enormous sigh and, as token of
sympathy, presented him with two doubtful pears and a broken
stick of chocolate.&nbsp; Bobbie went up towards New North Road
inventing further details of a gruesome nature, in the hope of
finding other shopkeepers similarly curious and appreciative, but
no one else called to him, and at a confectioner&rsquo;s shop,
where he waited for a long time, a girl with her hair screwed by
violent twists of paper came out and said that if he did not
leave off breathing on their window she would wring his neck for
him; upon Bobbie giving her a brief criticism in regard to the
arrangement of her features, she repeated her threat with
increased emphasis, and as there was obviously nothing to be
gained by further debate, he strolled off with dignity through
Fanshaw Street, arriving presently at Drysdale Street.&nbsp; The
boys here were boys with an intolerably good opinion of
themselves, because they lived in a street over which the railway
passed; this made them hold themselves aloof from the other
youths of Hoxton, and go through life with the austerity of men
who knew the last word about engines.&nbsp; It seemed to Bobbie
Lancaster that a chance had now arisen to humiliate Drysdale
Street and to lower its pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer!&rdquo; he said casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer!&rdquo; said the two boys.&nbsp; They were
marking out squares on the pavement for a game of
hop-scotch.&nbsp; &ldquo;Got any more chalk in your pocket,
Nose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy called Nose searched, and shook his head
negatively.&nbsp; &ldquo;Daresay I can oblige you,&rdquo;
remarked Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; said the first boy with heated
courtesy, &ldquo;did anyone ast you come &rsquo;ere
standin&rsquo; on our pavement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; acknowledged Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then!&nbsp; You trot off &rsquo;fore you get
&rsquo;urt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who you going to get to &rsquo;urt me?&rdquo; asked
Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to get no one,&rdquo; said the first boy
aggressively.&nbsp; &ldquo;Going to do it meself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should advise you to go into training a bit
first,&rdquo; said Bobbie kindly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Them arms and
wrists of yours I should sell for matches; your boots you might
get rid of as sailin&rsquo; vessels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Old my jacket, Nose,&rdquo; said the boy
furiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll knock the stuffin&rsquo; out
of him &rsquo;fore I&rsquo;m many minutes older.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a shirt like yourn,&rdquo; said Bobbie, edging
back a little, &ldquo;I should keep me jacket on.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll frighten all the birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better be off,&rdquo; said Nose, feeling it
safe now to offer a remark.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come down &rsquo;ere
temorrer, and we&rsquo;ll spoil your face for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a bit o&rsquo; doin&rsquo; to spoil yourn,&rdquo;
shouted Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come down temorrer,&rdquo; repeated Nose defiantly,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll give you what for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it the next day,&rdquo; called Bobbie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I shall be at the cimetry temorrer.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>&ldquo;Cimetry?&rdquo; said the two boys with a change
of voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cimetry!&rdquo; repeated Master Lancaster with
pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; said the first boy putting on
his jacket.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell us all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fen punchin&rsquo;,&rdquo; requested Bobbie
cautiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fen punchin&rsquo;,&rdquo; agreed the two Drysdale
Street boys.</p>
<p>Such was the respect Bobbie exacted from the two boys during
the truce and after his recital, that they not only allowed him
to lose a game of hop-scotch with them, but at his urgent request
they took him to the railway arch, and permitted him to climb to
a place where, when a train presently went shrieking overhead, a
thunderous noise came to his ears that deafened him.&nbsp; The
thin boy&rsquo;s name was George Libbis; the other boy&rsquo;s
name it appeared was not really Nose but Niedermann; called Nose
for brevity, and because that feature was unusually
prominent.&nbsp; With Master Libbis, Bobbie presently found
himself on good terms; with Nose he had, before saying good-bye,
a brief tussle over the possession of a piece of string, and went
off with a truculent remark concerning German Jews.</p>
<p>He felt so much advanced in society by reason of this entrance
into Drysdale Street circles that he declined games with boys of
Pimlico Walk, and affected not to see Trixie Bell dancing a
neighbour&rsquo;s baby that was not quite so large as herself,
but more muscular.&nbsp; Trixie called after him peremptorily,
but he went by with his head well up and eyes alert for signs of
interest.&nbsp; In Charles Square his reserve was broken by
sudden encounter with Ted Sullivan.&nbsp; Master Sullivan, in
possession of a toy pistol with small paper caps that snapped
quite loudly, told Bobbie in confidence that he had half made up
his mind to get a mask and go out somewhere and stop the mail
coach, shoot the driver, and take all the gold and bank-notes
that it carried.&nbsp; Upon Bobbie inquiring where he proposed to
find this mail coach, shoot the driver, and take the bullion,
Master Sullivan declared that there were plenty about if you only
knew where to find them, and in confirmation exhibited the
coloured paper cover of a well thumbed book, called
&ldquo;Dashing Dick Dare-devil, or the Highwayman and the
Faithful Indian Girl,&rdquo; confronted with which evidence
Bobbie Lancaster relinquished his argument and acknowledged that
Ted Sullivan had reason.&nbsp; Because these adventures are not
to be entered upon without rehearsal and taking thought, the two
had a brief game round the tipsy railings of the old square;
Bobbie starting from the county court was a restive steed
conveying a stage coach which bore untold gold, and just as he
galloped round by the untidy public-house at the north-west
corner, who should rush out upon him but Master Sullivan with
black dirt upon his face so that he should not be recognized, and
presenting the toy pistol with a stern warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stir but a single step and I fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon which, the restive steed tried to gallop over the
highwayman and to gallop round him, and eventually to turn and
gallop back; the highwayman was just on the point of snapping his
last cap and rendering the noble horse senseless when, most
inopportunely, the highwayman&rsquo;s mother appeared at the
corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teddy Sullivin!&nbsp; Come here, ye mis&rsquo;rable
little hound, and let me knock the head off of ye, ye onholy son
of a good parint that ye are.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>This
interruption left the struggle at a highly interesting point, but
Master Sullivan before leaving said that he proposed to get a
proper revolver, some day, and then there would be larks of the
rarest and most exciting kind.&nbsp; Meanwhile, added Master
Sullivan as he went off, the watchword was &ldquo;Death to
Injuns!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobbie, after a highly enjoyable morning, went home, where,
thanks to Mrs. Rastin, the house reeked with a perfectly
entrancing odour of frying steak and onions.&nbsp; To this meal
Mrs. Rastin invited a lady from downstairs, called the Duchess,
who wore several cheap rings and spoke with a tone of acquired
refinement that had always impressed Bobbie very much.&nbsp; He
remembered, though, that his mother had warned him never to speak
to this lady from downstairs, and when that vivacious lady
addressed him at his meal, he refused at first to answer her,
thus forcing the conversation to be shared exclusively by the two
ladies.&nbsp; They talked of rare tavern nights, the lady from
downstairs shaking her head reminiscently as she re-called
diverting incidents of the past, declaring that the world was no
longer what it had been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s no Cremorne, now,&rdquo; argued the
Duchess affectedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, true!&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Rastin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Argyll Rooms, and the rest of it, all swept
away,&rdquo; complained the Duchess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sickenin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Rastin.&nbsp; &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose they was rare times if the
truth was known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d never believe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Onfortunately,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rastin humbly, &ldquo;I
was country-bred meself.&nbsp; I wasted all the best years of my
life in service down in Essex.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, in my day,&rdquo; remarked the Duchess, smoothing
the torn lace at her sleeves, &ldquo;in my day I&rsquo;ve sat at
the same table with people that you couldn&rsquo;t tell from
gentlefolk, thinking no more of champagne than we do of
water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody never thought of walking,&rdquo; declared the
Duchess ecstatically.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was cabs here, cabs there,
cabs everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way,&rdquo; said the interested Mrs.
Rastin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk about sparkling conversation,&rdquo; said the
Duchess with enthusiasm.&nbsp; &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t talk like
it now, that&rsquo;s a very sure thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s come over
London,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Rastin despairingly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more like a bloomin&rsquo; church than anything
else.&nbsp; I s&rsquo;pose you was a fine-looking young woman in
those days, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose,&rdquo; said the Duchess,
&ldquo;there was ever a finer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night of that day became so extended by reason of a
generous supply of drink, that Bobbie went to bed in the corner
of the room and left the two women still reviewing the days and
nights that were.&nbsp; He understood their conversation
imperfectly (although God knows there was little in the way of
worldly knowledge hidden from him), but he decided that the
Duchess was worthy of some respect as one who had moved in
society, and when she stumbled over to him and kissed him,
crooning a comic song as lullaby, he felt gratified.&nbsp; He
remembered that his mother had kissed him once.&nbsp; It was when
he was quite a child; at about the time that his father
died.&nbsp; For the first time he found himself thinking of her,
and his mouth twitched, but he bent his mind determinedly to the
ride that <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>he was to enjoy in the morning, and having persuaded
himself that everything had happened for the best, went presently
to sleep, content.</p>
<p>The journey the next morning proved indeed to be all that
imagination had suggested, with a high wind added, with the
manners of a hurricane.&nbsp; There was a new peaked cap for him
to wear; the white collar was fixed with difficulty, being by
accident some two sizes too large and bulging accordingly.&nbsp;
Mrs. Rastin, swollen eyed partly with tears, assisted him to
dress; herself costumed in black garments borrowed from opulent
neighbours in the Walk.</p>
<p>A man appeared whom Bobbie recognized as the boy Nose&rsquo;s
father, and he, glancing round the room, said depreciatingly that
there was nothing there worth carting away, but Mrs. Rastin told
him to look at the chest of drawers; to look at the bedstead; to
look at the mirror.&nbsp; Mr. Niedermann, still contemptuous,
said that if he gave fifteen bob for the lot he should look down
on himself for being an adjective idiot; Mrs. Rastin reasoned
strongly against this attitude, saying that she was quite sure
that two pounds five would not hurt him.&nbsp; Mr. Niedermann
intimated, with much emphasis, that, on the contrary, two pound
five would do him very grievous injury, apart from the fact that,
by offering that sum, he would be making himself the
laughing-stock of all Hoxton.</p>
<p>A neighbour here looked in to announce that the carriage was
waiting, and after a sharp argument, conducted with great
asperity on both sides, Mrs. Rastin climbed down from two pounds
five to one pound two-and-six, and Mr. Niedermann, with a
generous flow of language that was in an inverse ratio to his
manner of disbursing money, climbed up to that amount, and Mr.
Niedermann&rsquo;s men came in and took everything away, leaving
the room empty and bare.&nbsp; Mr. Niedermann paid over the
amount, assuring Mrs. Rastin and Bobbie that a few jobs of
similar character would bankrupt him, and departed, Mrs. Rastin
acutely placing a small bag containing money under a loose plank
of the flooring where, as she said to the Duchess, it would be,
if anything, safer than in the Bank of England.&nbsp; The work
completed, Mrs. Rastin showed them out and locked the door,
placing the key under the mat.&nbsp; In Hoxton Street the
carriage waited; the gloomy horses, standing with feet extended
to avoid being blown away, turned round as the two came up
through admiring rows of people as who should say, &ldquo;Oh, you
have come at last, then.&rdquo;&nbsp; The scarlet-faced driver
and his colleague were rubbing marks of mud off the black
carriage; Trixie Bell was there, and slipped a clammy piece of
sweetstuff into Bobbie&rsquo;s hand as he was about to be lifted
into the coach, which piece of sweetstuff he instantly threw
away, to the regret of Trixie Bell and the joy of an infant at
whose feet it was thrown, and who apparently thought the age of
miracles had come again.&nbsp; The wind took off Bobbie&rsquo;s
new cap, carrying it sportively into a puddle.&nbsp; Fifty people
ran to recover it, and the cap came back with enough of the
puddle to give it age.&nbsp; Mrs. Rastin occupied the journey, as
the two gloomy horses trotted to the mortuary, with wise
precepts, to the effect that boys who couldn&rsquo;t keep their
new caps on, never by any dexterity or luck or artfulness went to
Heaven.&nbsp; Bobbie did not mind this; he was too much
interested in looking out of the window of the carriage.&nbsp; It
seemed to him that it was like belonging to the royal family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere we are, at the gates,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Rastin, finding her handkerchief.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now mind you cry
and behave yourself properly like a good boy, or <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>else, when I
get you &rsquo;ome, I&rsquo;ll give you the best shakin&rsquo;
you ever had in all your born days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t upset yourself,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll upset you, me lord,&rdquo; retorted Mrs.
Rastin.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to be knocked into shape a
bit before you&rsquo;ll be good for anything; &rsquo;itherto
you&rsquo;ve been allowed to do too much jest as you
bloomin&rsquo; well pleased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now who&rsquo;s behavin&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Bobbie
satirically.&nbsp; The carriage went slowly through the opened
iron gates and up the broad gravelled walk.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nice
language to use in a churchyard, I don&rsquo;t think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your fault,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rastin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you that&rsquo;ll get punished for
it,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another word,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Rastin strenuously,
&ldquo;and you don&rsquo;t get out of the kerrige.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try it on,&rdquo; said Bobbie, &ldquo;if you
dare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they had to wait some few minutes outside the chapel the
purple-faced driver came round to the window and, holding his
ruffled silk hat on, engaged Mrs. Rastin in conversation,
mentioning casually that he knew a place where presently as good
a glass of beer could be obtained as the heart desired.&nbsp;
Mrs. Rastin, promising to remember this, mentioned that for the
price, she thought it&mdash;meaning the coach and horses&mdash;by
no means a bad turn-out.&nbsp; The purple-faced coachman took
this compliment placidly, remarking that it was cutting it pretty
adjective fine to do the thing for two pun two, and if it were
his show he should decline to put the harness on the horses under
two pun twelve.&nbsp; If people liked to go and die, said the
coachman firmly, let them pay for it.&nbsp; On Mrs. Rastin
remarking that she supposed it was what we must all come to, the
coachman replied that Mrs. Rastin would be perfectly safe in
laying all the money she had got on that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now they&rsquo;re ready for us,&rdquo; said the
coachman.&nbsp; And whistled to his colleague.</p>
<p>Bobbie, following the draped case, which was borne on the
shoulders of the two men, felt full of regret that he had no
audience; Mrs. Rastin, blown about distractedly by the
tempestuous wind, appeared too much occupied to cry.&nbsp; The
young curate, in his white surplice, wore a skull cap and looked
resentfully at the elements as he spoke the opening words.&nbsp;
The liturgy came to Bobbie&rsquo;s ears in detachments when the
wind rested for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord, he
that believeth on me, though he were dead, yet. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, let me know mine end, and the number of my days.
. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh spare me a little that I may recover my strength
before I go hence and be no more seen. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>The small procession moved to a shallow opening in the clay
earth.&nbsp; The driver and his stolid companion let the long
draped case down to the side of this opening, the driver
complaining in an undertone of the other&rsquo;s clumsiness; as
lief have a plank of wood to help him, growled the driver.&nbsp;
The straps were placed round the long case; the boy watching had
difficulty in preventing himself from offering a word of
advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man that is born of woman hath but a short time to
live. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suffer us not in our last hour from any pains of death
to fall from Thee. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stolid man picked up a lump of dry clay and crumbled
it.</p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>&ldquo;Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God of His
great mercy to take unto Himself the soul of our dear sister here
departed. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently a prayer that Bobbie knew.&nbsp; He muttered it by
rote and without the least desire to consider the meaning of the
words.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our Fa&rsquo;r, chart in &rsquo;Eaven,
&rsquo;allowed be&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; The curate closed the book
and controlled his white surplice from the vagaries of the gusty
irreverent wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of
God, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all
evermore.&nbsp; Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This the poor creature&rsquo;s son?&rdquo; asked the
young curate briskly and cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her only boy, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are his aunt, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir!&nbsp; Only a well-meanin&rsquo; neighbour; he
ain&rsquo;t got any rel&rsquo;tives, worse luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re all alone in the world, my boy?&nbsp;
(Bother the wind!)&nbsp; Now you must make up your mind to be a
good lad, because there are plenty of people ready to help good
lads, and very few who will waste their time over bad
ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I tell him, sir,&rdquo; remarked Mrs.
Rastin ingratiatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t forget&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; The curate
stopped and sneezed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Enough to give anybody a
cold,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good-bye, my lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say good-bye to the kind gentleman, Bobbie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long,&rdquo; said Bobbie, resenting the interference
of Mrs. Rastin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look after that cold of
yourn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice thing to say, upon my word,&rdquo; declared Mrs.
Rastin, manoeuvring the wind.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got no
more idea of etiquette than a &rsquo;og.&nbsp; If it wasn&rsquo;t
that your poor mother was lying down there, poor thing, I&rsquo;d
give you a jolly good &rsquo;iding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me ketch you trying at it,&rdquo; said Bobbie
defiantly.</p>
<p>Thus, without a tear, the boy left the edge of the oblong hole
in clay earth, and was blown back to the carriage.&nbsp; Though
his eyes were dry and his manner aggressive, there came a
regretful feeling now all the excitement was over, that he had to
resume his position of an ordinary boy with no longer any special
claims to respect in Hoxton.&nbsp; He wondered vaguely what the
next few days would be like.&nbsp; He was not capable of looking
beyond that.&nbsp; At the gate Mrs. Rastin alighted to patronise
the house of refreshment so urgently recommended by the driver,
and whilst that purple-faced gentleman conducted her to the
private bar, Bobbie remained in the carriage, and the other man
came round and looked stolidly in through the window without
saying a word, as though Bobbie were a new arrival at the
Zoo.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Rastin, in excellent humour, returned, she brought a
seed biscuit for Bobbie, told him that he was a model boy, and
that she wished there were six of him for her to look after.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You run &rsquo;ome to your room,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Rastin, when the carriage stopped in Hoxton Street, &ldquo;the
key&rsquo;s under the mat, and I shan&rsquo;t be many minutes
&rsquo;fore I&rsquo;m with you.&nbsp; Wait for me, there&rsquo;s
a deer.&nbsp; I must have a drop of something short.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the walk he was hailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Bobbie Lancaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother says,&rdquo; began Trixie Bell, panting,
&ldquo;that you&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t talk to gels,&rdquo; said the boy,
marching on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Says that you ain&rsquo;t in&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be off, I tell you.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let me &rsquo;ave
to speak twice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you ain&rsquo;t in good &rsquo;ands where you are
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Bell, persistent, repeated the statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll pardon me,&rdquo; said the boy
laboriously, &ldquo;if I ast a rude question.&nbsp; Is your
mother still kerryin&rsquo; on her business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is,&rdquo; said Trixie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; he said, going on, &ldquo;tell
her to jolly well mind it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She says they&rsquo;re a bad lot,&rdquo; shouted the
girl, &ldquo;and she says they won&rsquo;t do you no
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me come back and pull your &rsquo;air
for you,&rdquo; entreated Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cow&mdash;werd!&rdquo; bawled Miss Trixie Bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cat!&rdquo; shouted Mr. Robert Lancaster.</p>
<p>Looking back as be pressed open the black door, he saw the
youth called Nose talking to the small girl, and he felt tempted
to return and punish both of them, but it occurred to him that a
man with a collar could not afford to appear undignified.&nbsp;
He went upstairs.&nbsp; The key not being under the mat, he sat
astride the rickety banisters and waited.&nbsp; He had found that
morning a half emptied box of fusees, and the time did not seem
long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me the key ain&rsquo;t under the
mat,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rastin truculently, as she came up the
stairs.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too lazy to look for it;
that&rsquo;s about the truth; you little&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find it yourself, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why &rsquo;ere it is in the door,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Rastin, &ldquo;in the door all the time.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
unlocked it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you got no eyes, you
good-for-nothing?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Rastin stumbled over the mat
and went into the dark room.&nbsp; &ldquo;Light a match when I
keep telling you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the room, Bobbie held up one of the flaming fusees.&nbsp;
Mrs. Rastin blinked, looked round, and screamed shrilly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murder!&rdquo; she wailed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Murder! Police!
Fire! Thieves!&rdquo;&nbsp; She gasped and recovered her
breath.&nbsp; &ldquo;Every penny gone of the money that was to
keep the young&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What money?&rdquo; asked the boy.&nbsp; The question
seemed to goad Mrs. Rastin to fury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out you go, you little devil,&rdquo; she cried
furiously.&nbsp; She took him by the back of his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind my collar,&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of it,&rdquo; she screamed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was
goin&rsquo; to be good-natured enough to keep you whilst the
bloomin&rsquo; money lasted, but now I&rsquo;ve had enough of
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; She lugged him out, despite his kicks, to the
landing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now then, out you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobbie fell down the staircase to the bottom.&nbsp; The
commotion had excited the house; doors were open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; said the Duchess
kindly.&nbsp; She wore an old, old satin gown, her lean,
rope-like throat uncovered.&nbsp; &ldquo;You come and live long
of us.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve of&rsquo;en wanted a child of me
own.&rdquo;</p>

20</span>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the Duchess and Mr. Leigh, her
husband, leaving Pimlico Walk somewhat hurriedly the next morning
with two barrow-loads of furniture and Bobbie Lancaster, Pimlico
Walk, led by Mrs. Rastin, did not hesitate to give them verbal
testimonials as to character.&nbsp; The husband, Mrs. Rastin
suggested, had robbed her of someone else&rsquo;s hard-earned
savings; the Duchess was condemned severely by those to whom she
had in effusive moments given her confidence.&nbsp; The
Duchess&rsquo;s husband was a quiet, resigned-looking man, with a
fringe of whiskers that met underneath his chin; his behaviour
conveyed the impression that he only desired to be let alone in
order that he might do good in a quiet, unobtrusive way.&nbsp; He
seemed, in regard to conversation, curt; he never used
superfluous words, and before he spoke he always drew in a
whistling breath looking around cautiously, as one anxious above
all things not to incriminate himself.&nbsp; He for his part took
the attacks of the neighbours quite calmly, and when the Duchess,
so indignant that she dropped a glass candlestick with lustres,
essayed to reply, he begged her to hold her tongue and to come
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Least said,&rdquo; remarked the Duchess&rsquo;s
husband, &ldquo;soonest mended.&nbsp; Give us a pound with this
barrer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I &rsquo;ope,&rdquo; screamed Mrs. Rastin,
&ldquo;that the money&rsquo;ll prove a curse to you if so be that
you&rsquo;re the party as took it.&nbsp; What&rsquo;ll become of
the poor kid don&rsquo;t bear thinking of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought you was going to have a &rsquo;igh old
time,&rdquo; retorted the Duchess, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;re
disappointed.&nbsp; Moment the money was spent you were going to
turn the poor boy out neck and crop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you measure other ladies by yourself,
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; shouted Mrs. Rastin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re nothing more nor less than&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said the Duchess&rsquo;s husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; urged the trembling Duchess, &ldquo;did you
&rsquo;ear what she called me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it matter?&rdquo; remarked the man.</p>
<p>Bobbie, helping to push one of the barrows through the Walk,
had the happy feeling that he had really been the cause of the
disturbance, and that he was engaged in making history very
fast.&nbsp; Trixie Bell&rsquo;s mother, standing at the door of
her small bonnet shop, shook her head dolefully as she saw him;
Bobbie make a grimace at her that checked the excellent
woman&rsquo;s sympathy.&nbsp; Behind the shop window Trixie Bell
herself looked out between the ostrich-feathered hats with round,
astonished eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the number, Leigh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Leigh gave the information as the two barrows turned from
Hoxton Street into Ely Place.&nbsp; Ely Place had more breadth
than Pimlico Walk, but it was a grim, mysterious thoroughfare, it
had none of the shops which served to make Pimlico Walk
interesting; certainly a few of the cottages had a plot in front
with a slate-coloured lawn, but these were in every case flagged
with imperfect drying linen that destroyed any pretence of
rusticity.&nbsp; Before one of these the barrows stopped.</p>
<p>A long young woman with sleeves folded back high above her
elbow, <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>her
red hair in a single knot, swept the step casually with a bald
broom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ullo,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
arrived, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Leigh seemed about to reply in the affirmative, but
stopped himself leaving the confession to the Duchess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bat&rsquo;s gone out in the Kingsland Road,&rdquo; went
on the red-haired young woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked the Duchess, unloading the
barrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To get change,&rdquo; said the young woman.</p>
<p>This reply amused the Duchess so much that, casting away
resentment against the world in general and Pimlico Walk in
particular, she rested a chair-bedstead in the dim passage and
sat down upon it to enjoy the laugh.&nbsp; Bobbie, anxious to
show himself as one of the family, laughed too, and Mr. Leigh
almost smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a caution,&rdquo; said the Duchess
exhaustedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What &rsquo;ave I said now?&rdquo; asked the young
woman, with all a humorist&rsquo;s assumption of gravity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t so much what you say as your
manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This your tenth?&rdquo; asked the girl, resting her
chin on the broom and nodding her head in the direction of
Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a little chap,&rdquo; explained the amused
Duchess, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s left without a parent, and
we&rsquo;re going to look after him.&nbsp; Ain&rsquo;t we,
Leigh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ast me,&rdquo; begged Mr. Leigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll come in useful,&rdquo; whispered the
Duchess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bat don&rsquo;t care for kids about the
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s as knowing,&rdquo; urged the Duchess,
&ldquo;as a grown-up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is only our town &rsquo;ouse,&rdquo; explained the
red-haired young woman to Bobbie.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rather
&rsquo;andsome, palatial sort of mansion, don&rsquo;t you
think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell better,&rdquo; said Bobbie, looking round,
&ldquo;when someone&rsquo;s give it a good clean down.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s in the room at the back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ask my &rsquo;usband that question when he comes
&rsquo;ome,&rdquo; said the young woman with sudden acerbity,
&ldquo;and he&rsquo;ll strap you till he&rsquo;s
tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t ask him, then,&rdquo; said Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never pry, Bobbie,&rdquo; counselled the Duchess
warningly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Little boys that go prying never come to
no good.&nbsp; Carry that lamp upright, and don&rsquo;t upset the
oil, or I&rsquo;ll upset you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobbie, submitted to Mr. Bat Miller upon that
gentleman&rsquo;s return from obtaining change in Kingsland Road,
was so fortunate as to obtain favour, and Bat Miller after
telling the young woman, who seemed of a jealous disposition,
exactly how his time had been occupied, ruffled the boy&rsquo;s
head of hair, telling him that if he behaved himself he should
learn in that house everything worth knowing.&nbsp; But none of
your tricks mind, said Mr. Bat Miller.&nbsp; As a first test Mr.
Miller took a bright two shilling-piece from an inside pocket of
his waistcoat, and, spite of the protests of the two women,
dispatched him with it to a certain shop in Hackney Road to
purchase one ounce of shag.&nbsp; When Bobbie returned, panting,
with the tobacco in a screw of paper and the change safely in his
fist, Bat Miller first tested the coins by trying them with his
teeth, and then gave Bobbie for himself a penny, some of the
tobacco, and commendation in congratulatory but lurid
terms.&nbsp; The two men went out together, and the Duchess and
young Mrs. Bat Miller exchanged grievances, Mrs. Miller <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>complaining a
good deal of her husband&rsquo;s irregular behaviour, and
presently they too, finding themselves in agreement on several
questions, went out, locking the boy in that he might look after
the house.&nbsp; They promised to be absent for not more than two
seconds, but by some error they made it two hours, and during
that time Bobbie prowled over the house and went into every room,
excepting only the locked-up room at the back of the ground
floor.</p>
<p>At the door of this locked-up room he listened very
carefully.&nbsp; The keyhole being plugged, he could see nothing,
but he kept his ear to the door for some time.&nbsp; It seemed to
him that a sound of heavy breathing came from within.</p>
<p>The two couples came home in admirable temper.&nbsp; Even Mr.
Leigh&rsquo;s attitude to the world seemed less guarded, and
several times he appeared inclined to sing with the rest.&nbsp;
They brought in with them fried potatoes, fish, and a large
bottle; Bobbie, to his astonishment and great satisfaction, being
allowed to help himself.&nbsp; The Duchess repeated the anecdotes
of high life in the sixties that Bobbie had heard before, Mr.
Leigh watching her with pride as she assumed her accent of
refinement, and ordering her to tell more than one account of a
past evening twice over.&nbsp; Later, young Mrs. Miller let down
her knot of red hair, and recited a touching poem about a Russian
mother who being torn from her family to endure punishment in
Siberia, apparently objected to it very much and pleaded with the
soldiers, but with no avail until presently her youngest born
argued with them, and then the officer in charge relenting,
kissed the babe and said, &ldquo;Your mother&rsquo;s safe, my
darling child.&nbsp; To you she owes her life; For I, too, have
an infant mild, Also a loving wife.&rdquo;&nbsp; At which
pleasing point the recital finished, leaving the hearers content,
with perhaps a slight fear that the tender-hearted officer might
have had some trouble in explaining his conduct to his superior
officers.&nbsp; Then Mr. Bat Miller, a little sleepy, sang a
long, long song, relating vaguely to the sea, with a refrain of
&ldquo;What ho for the rolling wave, me boys, And a life on the
vasty deep,&rdquo; and when he had finished, the Duchess
consented, after a good deal of pressing, to give her imitation
of a well-known serio-comic lady whose star had been high some
twenty-five years previously, a performance requiring a hiccough
that the Duchess had no difficulty in repeating.&nbsp; Bobbie had
seldom enjoyed an afternoon so much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time for the Fright&rsquo;s &rsquo;alf pint,
ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Mr. Leigh.</p>
<p>The wooden clock on the mantel-piece had just struck twelve,
as notification that it was six o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough left in the jug, ain&rsquo;t there?&rdquo; asked
Mrs. Miller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bit flat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He don&rsquo;t care whether its flat or round,&rdquo;
said the humorous young woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all one to
the Fright.&nbsp; Bat, wake up and look after your
lodger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bat Miller awakened, took the large bottle, and went out into
the passage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back, Bobbie,&rdquo; cried the Duchess,
sharply.&nbsp; The boy did not obey, being indeed accustomed to
persist in doing anything that he was told not to do.&nbsp; Mr.
Leigh rushed out, and catching him, swung him back into the
room.&nbsp; The two women boxed his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stiddy,&rdquo; said the boy resentfully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Three to one&rsquo;s plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you before not to pry,&rdquo; said the
Duchess.</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>&ldquo;Who was prying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; said Mr. Leigh, as peacemaker,
&ldquo;come out &rsquo;long o&rsquo; me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you goin&rsquo;, Leigh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Station,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you reported yourself yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mr. Leigh, finding his
cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get yourself into trouble some day,&rdquo;
remarked the Duchess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time,&rdquo; interposed
young Mrs. Miller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got the ticket with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course I &rsquo;ave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Leigh took from his inside pocket a sheet of paper about
the size of an ordinary letter; he replaced it in an envelope and
led Bobbie out of the house.&nbsp; In Kingsland Road they turned
to the right.&nbsp; Opposite were the low almshouses standing in
their own grounds and protected by a low iron spiked wall.&nbsp;
The two went towards Shoreditch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we going to book to?&rdquo; asked Bobbie,
&ldquo;when we get to the station?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Leigh did not
answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Going for ride in the train, ain&rsquo;t
we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What station are we going to, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Police station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere,&rdquo; said the boy, stopping.&nbsp;
&ldquo;None of your &rsquo;alf larks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right, kiddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the row, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No row,&rdquo; said Mr. Leigh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Slight
fermality, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobbie&rsquo;s fears proved groundless.&nbsp; Mr. Leigh went
up the steps of the police station, where one or two uniformed
men and a few men in plain clothes stood under the blue lamp, and
these nodded to Mr. Leigh.&nbsp; Bobbie waited in the hall in
order that, necessity arising, he might make swift escape, and
Mr. Leigh, taking off his cap respectfully, tapped at a wooden
window.&nbsp; The window opened; the face of an inspector
appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evenin&rsquo;, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Leigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, me man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice bright, cold autumn weather, sir,&rdquo; said Mr.
Leigh, holding his cap between his teeth and finding the sheet of
paper.&nbsp; &ldquo;Soon be &rsquo;aving winter on us
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it had turned warmer,&rdquo; said the
inspector, taking a book down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;raps you&rsquo;re right, sir,&rdquo; said Mr.
Leigh obsequiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to remember your name,&rdquo; said the
inspector, turning over the pages of the book.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Begins with an L, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right again, sir.&nbsp; Name of
Leigh&mdash;Abraham Leigh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found it,&rdquo; said the inspector, who had
been running his finger down the page.&nbsp; &ldquo;Got the
ticket?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Leigh passed in the sheet of letter paper, and the
inspector, comparing it with the entry in the book, endorsed
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems all right,&rdquo; said the inspector.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slight alteration of address,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Leigh
humbly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now residing at 112, Ely Place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rum quarter,&rdquo; said the inspector, as he made a
note.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must live somewhere, sir,&rdquo; submitted Mr.
Leigh.</p>
<p><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>&ldquo;Going on straight now?&rdquo; asked the
inspector, as he handed the note back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather,&rdquo; answered Mr. Leigh complacently.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Turned over a new leaf, I &rsquo;ave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Other bisness don&rsquo;t pay, sir,&rdquo; said Mr.
Leigh, replacing the folded sheet of paper in his pocket.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mug&rsquo;s game, that&rsquo;s what I call
it.&nbsp; Good day, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day, me man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Shutting the window to
with a decisive snap.</p>
<p>Mr. Leigh, coming down the steps with Bobbie, was spoken to
casually by one of the plain clothes men, who in an uninterested
way asked Mr. Leigh some questions concerning (it appeared to the
boy) mutual acquaintances, but Mr. Leigh seemed unable to give
the plain clothes man any of the information desired, complaining
as excuse of decaying powers of memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it must be I&rsquo;m getting old, Mr. Thorpe,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll grow on you,&rdquo; said the plain
clothes man, &ldquo;if you aren&rsquo;t careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember names,&rdquo; declared Mr.
Leigh, complainingly; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember faces; I
can&rsquo;t remember any mortal thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the detective, &ldquo;pity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Bobbie, as they walked home to Ely Place, Mr. Leigh
appeared slightly more communicative, counselling the boy to
behave decorously if ever he should find himself in trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inside or outside,&rdquo; declared Mr. Leigh, &ldquo;it
pays in the long run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Ely Place everything was in train, the day being special
and the evening also out of the ordinary, for a visit to the
theatre.&nbsp; Some question arose in regard to the wisdom of
leaving the house alone, but young Mrs. Miller said that she
wasn&rsquo;t going to be left out of it if Bat were going, the
Duchess said it wasn&rsquo;t often she got the chance, Mr. Leigh
said he didn&rsquo;t see no particular harm in going to the play,
Bat Miller said that too much work told on a man; that the Fright
would be safe enough, and it would make a nice change for all of
them.&nbsp; So they all went.&nbsp; Bat Miller locked the door
with great care, and in five minutes they were finding their way
up the broad stone stairs of the Britannia with a struggling,
anxious, noisy, good-tempered crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right sort,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Leigh, in a whisper to
Bat Miller, as they forced their way to the pay box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; agreed Bat Miller.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want no fuss &rsquo;ere.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
pinched the ear of a dark young woman in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have your black eyes,&rdquo; he said
admiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get two of your own if you ain&rsquo;t
careful,&rdquo; retorted the girl, not displeased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t mind being punched by you,&rdquo; said
Bat Miller.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me keep these others from scrouging
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bat,&rdquo; cried a voice behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now begin agin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave off talkin&rsquo; to that nigger gel,&rdquo;
commanded young Mrs. Miller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you callin&rsquo; a nigger gel,&rdquo; inquired
the dark young woman across the heads of the surging crowd,
&ldquo;carrots?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Miller frankly, &ldquo;Miss
Tar Brush.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t answer her,&rdquo; begged Mr. Bat
Miller to his new acquaintance.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so
jealous she can&rsquo;t see straight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pity you,&rdquo; said the dark young woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Mr. Miller softly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lemme get your ticket for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A roaring noisy crowded gallery, like the side of a mountain
going from the base with strong iron rods protecting up to the
topmost point, where patrons had to bend their backs to escape
the ceiling.&nbsp; General discardment of coats by men and boys,
universal doffing of hats and bonnets, and loosening of blouses
by ladies.&nbsp; Bobbie, perched on the rolled-up coats of the
two men, saw at a distance of what seemed at first to be several
miles below, the tightly-wedged people on the floor of the
theatre packed closely to the very footlights, and leaving just
sufficient room for a small orchestra.&nbsp; Mrs. Bat Miller,
still trembling with annoyance, bought oranges, and selecting one
over ripe, stood up and threw it, and more by luck than skill,
managed to hit the dark young woman, seated below, well on the
side of the face, where it burst shell-like and caused
annoyance.&nbsp; Having done this, young Mrs. Miller seemed more
content, and twisting up her rope of red hair, settled down to
unrestrained enjoyment of the evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave your dispisition,&rdquo;
said Mr. Bat Miller to her, wistfully, &ldquo;for a
bloomin&rsquo; pension.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobbie felt pleased to see the two boys from Drysdale Street
far above him; they would require all the austerity that a
railway arch could give to prevent them from feeling envious of
him.&nbsp; He held up a piece of apple and shouted above the
babel of voices, &ldquo;&rsquo;Ave &rsquo;alf?&rdquo; and when
they screamed back &ldquo;Yus!&rdquo; he ate it all calmly; thus
goading them to a state of speechless vexation.&nbsp; Everybody
called to everybody else; the enormous theatre filled with
appeals for recognition.&nbsp; Presently through the uproar could
be heard the discordant tuning up of the violins, and, holding
the Duchess&rsquo;s thin arm, he looked down again and saw that
the orchestra had come in.</p>
<p>The footlights being turned up, the violins began to
play.&nbsp; The Duchess said it was nothing to the Alhambra in
the old days, but Bobbie felt this could not be true.&nbsp; When
the curtain ascended and the uniformed men posted in various
quarters of the large theatre bawled for silence, Bobbie held
tightly to the Duchess for fear that he might be tempted to jump
over.</p>
<p>It was not easy to discover at first the true intent of the
play, because the gallery did not at once become quiet; two
fights and a faint were necessary before quietude could be
obtained.&nbsp; When the words from the far-off stage came up
more distinctly to Bobbie&rsquo;s quick ears, he realized that a
plot was being arranged by two gentlemanly men in evening dress
to rob the bank of the sum of fifty thousand pounds, and it
seemed that they wished to do this unobtrusively, and indeed
desired that any credit for its success should be placed to the
account not of themselves, but of the manager of the bank.&nbsp;
The manager came on just then to a majestic air from the
orchestra; the audience seemed to know him, for they cheered, and
he stood in the centre of the stage bowing condescendingly before
he commenced to interest himself in the drama.&nbsp; He was
rather a noble-looking young man, a little stout perhaps, with a
decided way of speaking; you could hear every word he said, and
when he had to make any movement the orchestra played briskly, as
though to intimate that whatever misfortune might cross his path,
he had always the support <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>of four fiddlers, two bass viols, a
cornet, a pianist, and a trombone.&nbsp; The two villains
intimated their desire to open an account at the bank.&nbsp; The
manager asked for references.&nbsp; The two villains, first
looking cautiously off at the wings to make sure that no one
observed them, suddenly flung themselves on the bank
manager.&nbsp; They were engaged in binding him with ropes, when
a ragged boy (who the Duchess said was not a boy but a girl)
jumped in at the window, and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What price me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon which the two villains instantly decamped; the ragged boy
summoned the clerks (who, reasonably speaking, should have heard
the struggle, but apparently did not), and the manager ordered
that the ragged boy should he offered a highly responsible post
in the bank, for, said the manager to the gallery, of what use is
sterling honesty in this world if it be not liberally rewarded? a
sentiment with which the gallery found itself able to express
cordial agreement.&nbsp; In the next scene the two gentlemanly
villains, undeterred by their rebuff, were seen in a vague light,
drilling with caution the cardboard door of an immense safe of
the bank.&nbsp; They had but just succeeded when voices were
heard.&nbsp; Plaintive music and entrance of heroine.&nbsp;
Dressed in white, she had come to bring a posy of flowers to the
manager, whom, it appeared, she was to marry on the morrow.&nbsp;
This visit seemed unnecessary, and it was certainly indiscreet;
after the manager had surprised her and had given to the gallery
a few choice opinions on the eternal power of Love, which made
Mrs. Bat Miller so agitated that her rope of red hair became
untied, the heroine went, after an affectionate farewell, leaving
a note on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve dropped something, Miss,&rdquo; shouted
Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ush,&rdquo; warned the Duchess.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s done a purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This note the villains found, after a struggle with the girl
boy, who, demanding of them, &ldquo;What price me?&rdquo; was
clubbed on the head, and left insensible.&nbsp; The note only
required a slight alteration with the tearing off of one page to
be construed into evidence of complicity in the crime; so that
when, in the next scene, a cheerful wedding party in secondhand
clothes came out of the church door, bells ringing, villagers
strewing flowers, and wedding march from the orchestra, two
constables suddenly pushed their way through the crowd and placed
hands on the shoulders of the astonished bride, causing so much
consternation that the bells stopped, the wedding march changed
into a hurried frantic movement, what time the bride clutched at
her bodice, and assured the gallery (but this they knew full
well) that she was innocent.&nbsp; A boy inspector, with a piping
voice, stepped forward and proceeded to act in accordance with
stage law.&nbsp; Woman, I arrest you.&nbsp; Oh, sir,
explain.&nbsp; This letter (said the inspector) in your
handwriting was found in the bank after the robbery.&nbsp; Sir,
said the tearful bride, &rsquo;tis true I wrote that letter,
but&mdash;.&nbsp; Woman (said the stern boy inspector),
prevarication is useless; who were your accomplices?&nbsp; You
decline to answer?&nbsp; Good!&nbsp; Officers, do your
duty.&nbsp; Scoundrels (shouted the bridegroom bank manager),
unhand her, before God she is innocent as the driven snow, I
swear it.&nbsp; Ho, ho (remarked the boy inspector, acutely
putting two and two together), then this can only mean&mdash;here
the orchestra became quite hysterical&mdash;that you yourself are
guilty.&nbsp; Officers, arrest him also!&nbsp; May Heaven, begged
the bride emotionally, addressing the gallery, may Heaven in its
great mercy, protect the innocent and the pure.&nbsp; It seemed
that Heaven proved somewhat tardy in responding <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>to the
heroine&rsquo;s appeal, for from a quarter to eight until a
quarter to eleven, she and the hero found themselves in a
succession of the direst straits, which, apportioned with
justice, would have been more than enough for fifty young
couples.&nbsp; It did seem that they could not by any dexterity
do the right thing; whereas, the two villains, on the contrary,
prospered exceedingly, to the special annoyance of Mr. Bat
Miller, who, constituting himself leader of a kind of vigilance
committee in the hot perspiring gallery, led off the hisses
whenever either or both appeared, and at certain
moments&mdash;as, for instance, when in the hospital ward they
lighted their cigarettes, and discussed cynically the prospect of
the injured boy&rsquo;s speedy departure from life&mdash;hurling
down at them appropriate and forcible words of reproof, that did
credit alike to his invention and to the honesty of his
feelings.</p>
<p>It is only fair to add that the gallery gave to Mr. Miller
ready and unanimous assistance.&nbsp; How they yelled with
delight when the boy (who was a girl) defied one of the villains,
and bade him do his worst!&nbsp; How they shivered when the
villain, producing a steel dagger, crept furtively up to the boy,
whose back was turned, and how they shouted with rapture as the
boy, swinging round at exactly the right moment, presented a
revolver at the villain&rsquo;s forehead, causing that despicable
person to drop the dagger and go weak at the knees.&nbsp; How
they held their breath when, on the boy incautiously laying down
the revolver and going to look at the wings, the villain obtained
possession of the deadly weapon, and covered the boy with
it.&nbsp; And then when the boy had affected to cower and to beg
for mercy (which, it need hardly be said, the villain flatly
declined to grant), how they screamed with mad ecstasy on the boy
saying with sudden calm,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By-the-bye!&nbsp; Hadn&rsquo;t you better make sure
that that little pop-gun&rsquo;s loaded?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Causing the villain to curse his fate and to snap the trigger
ineffectually, thus giving the boy a cue for saying once
more,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What price me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobbie in support whistled and hissed and howled so much, that
after a while he became exhausted, and to his regret found
himself unable to express opinions with vigour; this did not,
however, prevent him from weeping bitter tears over the hospital
scene.&nbsp; It was in the hospital scene, as a matter of fact,
that the luck of the hero and heroine turned.&nbsp; The injured
youngster suddenly recovered sight and reason; denounced the two
villains, now cringing beneath the triumphant, hysterical
theatre; called upon the boy inspector, fortunately at the wings,
to arrest them, which the boy inspector instantly did, thus
retrieving his position in the esteem of the audience; amid an
increasing hum of approval from the mountain of heads in front,
the youngster arranged from his couch for the future happiness of
the hero and heroine, capping it all and extracting a roar from
the house by remarking,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what price me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which might have been the pure essence distilled from all the
best jokes of all time, judging from its instantaneous and
admirable effect.&nbsp; Then the hero and heroine, at the centre
of the stage, managed to intimate that sunshine had broken
through the clouds; that trustful and loving, they would now
proceed to live a life of absolute peace and perfect happiness;
the orchestra feeling itself rewarded at last for all its
faithful attention, broke out into a triumphant march,
and&mdash;rideau.</p>
<p><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>In
Hoxton Street it was drizzling, and the crowd surging out of the
doorway turned up its coat collars and tied handkerchiefs over
its bonnets, and set off for home.&nbsp; Bobbie, dazed with
excitement, clutched the Duchess&rsquo;s yellow skirt and trotted
along, after a minute&rsquo;s rest at a whelk stall, the two men
and Mrs. Miller following closely behind.&nbsp; At the corner of
Essex Street they waited to allow a four-wheeler to go by.&nbsp;
The elderly horse, checked by the driver, slipped, and nearly
fell, recovered itself, and slipped again, made vain efforts to
get a secure footing, and upon the driver standing up to use his
whip and saying bitterly, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you fall down
and &rsquo;ave done with it,&rdquo; did fall down, and remained
there.&nbsp; A small crowd formed without a moment&rsquo;s delay;
Mr. Bat Miller went to the stout old gentleman inside the cab,
now trying without success to let down the window, and opening
the door, assured him with great courtesy that he had no cause
for fear.&nbsp; Having done this, Mr. Miller re-closed the door
and stepped back.&nbsp; He passed something furtively to
red-haired Mrs. Miller, who slipped the something into
Bobbie&rsquo;s pocket, telling him in a commanding whisper to cut
off home like mad.&nbsp; Bobbie, feeling that he was helping in
some proceeding of an imperial nature, complied, noting as he
darted away the very stout gentleman hammering with his fists at
the closed window of the four-wheeler.&nbsp; Mr. Miller sauntered
off Kingsland Road way; the two women and Mr. Leigh went
unconcernedly to a public-house.</p>
<p>Bobbie was shivering when five minutes later the company
rejoined him at the street door of the house in Ely Place.&nbsp;
Mr. Miller found his key and let them in.&nbsp; The smelly lamp
in the passage burned low; in the closed back room a quavering
voice sang a hymn.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dare to be a Daniyul,<br />
Dare to stand alone,<br />
Dare to &rsquo;ave a purpose firm,<br />
And dare&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Shut it!&rdquo; commanded Bat Miller, knocking at the
door of the back room sharply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Get off to sleep,
can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;&nbsp; He turned to the others.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he said with a change of manner,
&ldquo;let&rsquo;s see what kind of a little present this young
genelman&rsquo;s bin and brought &rsquo;ome for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I b&rsquo;lieve he pinched it for me,&rdquo; said young
Mrs. Miller cheerfully, &ldquo;&rsquo;cause to-day isn&rsquo;t my
birthday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobbie, with something of majesty, brought from his pocket a
heavy gold watch and part of a gold chain, and laid them on the
table.&nbsp; The four put their heads together and examined the
property.&nbsp; Then they beamed round upon the small boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I foresee, Bobbie,&rdquo; said the Duchess, in
complimentary tones, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;re a goin&rsquo; to
grow up a bright, smart, useful young chep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll want trainin&rsquo;,&rdquo; suggested Mr.
Bat Miller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And watchin&rsquo;,&rdquo; growled Mr. Leigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when he gets to be a man,&rdquo; said young Mrs.
Miller facetiously, as she pulled off her boots, &ldquo;all the
gels in the neighbourhood &rsquo;ll be after him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these praises clanging and resounding in his heated
little brain, Bobbie went upstairs to bed.</p>
<h2><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">For</span> nearly a year Bobbie Lancaster
lived his young life in Ely Place.&nbsp; Although every day was
not so full of incident as the first, he could not charge dulness
against his existence; the standard of happiness set up in Ely
Place not being a high one, was therefore easily reached;
monotony at any rate came rarely.&nbsp; When other plans failed,
quarrels could always be relied upon, and these gave such joy,
not only to the chief actors and actresses, but also to the
audience, that it seemed small wonder so successful a performance
should be frequently repeated.&nbsp; Now and again events
occurred which flattered Bobbie, and gave him the dearest
satisfaction a small boy can experience&mdash;that of being
treated as though he were grown up.&nbsp; It had not taken Mr.
Leigh and Mr. Bat Miller long to recognize that in Bobbie they
had a promising apprentice; one so obstinately honest as to be of
great assistance to them in their dishonest profession.&nbsp;
They exercised due caution in taking him into their
confidence.&nbsp; For instance, he was still at the end of the
year not sure why it was that the back room on the ground floor
remained always locked; why its windows, facing a yard, and
overlooked by the huge straggling workhouse, were closely
shuttered.&nbsp; He knew that a man worked there; he knew that
this man was called The Fright, and Mrs. Miller, on one expansive
evening when in admirable humour, told him that The Fright was by
trade a silver chaser.&nbsp; Presuming on some additional
knowledge acquired at a time when supposed to be asleep, he
demanded of the two men further particulars; Mr. Bat Miller
replied fiercely that spare the rod and spoil the child had never
been his motto, and thereupon gave Bobbie the worst thrashing
that the boy had ever dreamed of.&nbsp; Following this, the boy
found himself for some days treated with great coldness by the
adult members of the household, and made to feel that he was no
longer in the movement.&nbsp; When either of the men went out in
the evening, the boy was not permitted to go also; he found
himself deprived of adventurous excursions into the suburbs; the
casual loafing about at busy railway stations was denied to
him.&nbsp; So keenly did he feel this ostracism that he had
tumultuous thoughts of giving himself up to the School Board
inspector whom he had hitherto dodged, and of devoting his time
to the acquirement of useful knowledge; it is right to add that
the idea of betraying any of the secrets which he had learnt
concerning the habits of the two men never for a moment occurred
to him.&nbsp; An alternative was to buy a revolver similar to the
one possessed by Teddy Sullivan, and to go out somewhere and
shoot someone; the latter faintly-sketched plan was rubbed out
because Master Sullivan, his friend, encountered disaster one
evening in Union Street.&nbsp; In the course of a strenuous
hand-to-hand fight between Hackney Road boys and Hoxton boys, a
point arrived where the Hoxton boys found themselves badly
worsted, whereupon Master Sullivan, with a sentence plagiarized
from a penny romance which he knew almost by heart, &ldquo;Ten
thousand furies take you, you dastardly scoundrels,&rdquo;
whipped out his revolver, and closing his eyes, fired, injuring
two or three promising juveniles from the tributary streets of
Hackney Road, and, as a last consequence of this act, finding
himself exposed to the glory of police court proceedings, and to
the indignity of a birching.</p>
<p><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>Tension
was snapped by a quarrel between Mr. Bat Miller and his young
wife.&nbsp; There were times when Mrs. Bat Miller was obtrusively
affectionate with her husband; as compensation, occasions flew in
when she became half mad with jealousy.&nbsp; The Duchess and Mr.
Leigh at these crises acted as peacemakers, a task at times not
easy; in this particular case they failed entirely.&nbsp; The
young woman tore her red hair with fury; she screamed so loudly
that, common as such exhibitions were in Ely Place, neighbours
began to show some interest in the front door.&nbsp; In this
difficulty Mr. Bat Miller, pained and distressed, appealed to
Bobbie to state whether so far from having been walking with the
sister of Nose, the boy of Drysdale Street, between the hours of
nine and ten that evening, he had not as a matter of fact been in
the company of Bobbie at Liverpool Street Station.&nbsp; To this
question Bobbie (who at the hours mentioned had been having a
gloomy and quite solitary game of hop-scotch at the Kingsland
Road end of Ely Place) answered promptly, &ldquo;Yus!&rdquo; and
Mrs. Bat Miller confronted with this proof of alibi burst into
regretful tears and reproached herself for a silly woman, one who
allowed herself to be taken in by the gossip of any spiteful cat
of a neighbour.&nbsp; Mr. Miller, grateful to Bobbie for this
timely assistance, persuaded the quiet Leigh to allow the boy to
resume his position in their confidence.&nbsp; After some
hesitation Mr. Leigh agreed, adding, however, that he hoped
Bobbie would see that the first duty of little boys was to be
seen and not heard; the second, not to go about interfering with
what did not concern them.&nbsp; These Mr. Leigh declared to be
ever golden rules, not to be broken without danger.&nbsp; Bobbie
promised to bear the advice carefully in mind, and re-assumed his
position in the house with satisfaction.</p>
<p>The two women were nearly always kind to him, and to them he
became indebted for cheerful hours.&nbsp; The proudest memory of
the Duchess&rsquo;s was that of her one appearance on the music
hall stage.&nbsp; It seemed that another young lady and herself,
having, in the late sixties, saved their money, had made their
bow from the small stage of a small hall attached to a small
public-house in Banner Street, St. Luke&rsquo;s.&nbsp; They
called themselves the Sisters Montmorency (on the urgent
recommendation of the agent), and sang a song which still
remained her favourite air.&nbsp; When in very good temper and
when Bobbie had been a very good boy, she would go out of the
room, and re-enter with a fine swish of the skirts singing in a
thin, quavering voice this verse:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>You should see us in our landor when we&rsquo;re
drivin&rsquo; in the Row,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You should &rsquo;ear us chaff the dukes and belted
earls;<br />
We&rsquo;re daughters of nobility, so they treat us with
ceevility,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For of well-bred, high-class damsels we&rsquo;re the
pearls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It appeared that the two d&eacute;butantes quarrelled with
each other after the first performance over some point of
etiquette and fought in Banner Street, St. Luke&rsquo;s; as a
consequence the partnership had thereupon been dissolved, and the
Duchess&rsquo;s career as an artiste of the music halls found
itself checked and stopped.</p>
<p>Proud in the ownership of a new bowler hat; magnificent in the
possession of a four-bladed knife with a corkscrew, which had
come to him as his share of the contents of a portmanteau
labelled from Scarborough to King&rsquo;s Cross, and taken
possession of at the latter station by Mr. Miller before the
owner had time to claim it, Bobbie strolled along Old Street one
evening, smoking a cigarette, and pushing small girls off the
pavement <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>into the roadway.&nbsp; Behind him walked Miss Trixie
Bell, feathered hatted and a skirt furtively let out after
departure from her mother&rsquo;s shop in Pimlico Walk; Miss
Bell, in crossing lakes on the pavement, felt justified in
lifting her skirt carefully to avoid contact with the ground,
which it cleared by about twelve inches.&nbsp; At a junction of
the City Road the boy stopped to allow the confused trams to
untie themselves, and looking round saw her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer!&rdquo; said Miss Bell with defiant
shyness.&nbsp; &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the world using
you?&rdquo;&nbsp; Bobbie did not answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
ain&rsquo;t seen me for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t wanted,&rdquo; replied the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been away in the country,&rdquo; said the
young woman, in no way disconcerted.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Mongst
medders and pigs and farm yards and nuts, and I don&rsquo;t know
what all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You still living in Ely Place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;raps I am; p&rsquo;raps I
ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t live there for something,&rdquo;
remarked the girl, shrugging her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t let you,&rdquo; replied the
boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re very particular about the
kerricter of people they &rsquo;ave there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must they all &rsquo;ave a bad kerricter?&rdquo; asked
Miss Bell innocently.</p>
<p>The trams at the junction of roads extricated themselves from
the tangle, and people who had been waiting on the kerb went
across the roadway.&nbsp; Trixie Bell followed Bobbie, and they
walked on opposite sides of the dimly-lighted pavement near St.
Luke&rsquo;s Asylum, continuing their conversation with breaks
occasioned by intervening passers-by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no call,&rdquo; shouted the boy, &ldquo;to
come follering me about.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want no truck with
gels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose you&rsquo;ve bought the street,
ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Miss Bell loudly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Seem
to think you&rsquo;re everybody &rsquo;cause you&rsquo;ve got a
bowler &rsquo;at on.&nbsp; Be wearing a chimney-pot next, I
lay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t ask your permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the boys down in the country,&rdquo; called out the
girl, &ldquo;wash &rsquo;emselves twice a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More fools them,&rdquo; said Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t dare be seen going about with a
dirty face and neck like what you&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; said the boy savagely.&nbsp; He
moved nearer to her.&nbsp; &ldquo;You leave my face and neck
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to do otherwise,&rdquo; she remarked pertly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I want any remarks from you &rsquo;bout my face
and neck I&rsquo;ll ast for &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Till then you keep
your mouth shut &rsquo;r I&rsquo;ll shut it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d do a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobbie lifted his arm, but the small girl did not
flinch.&nbsp; He made another threatening gesture; instantly his
new bowler hat went spinning into the middle of the road in
imminent danger of being run over by a railway van.&nbsp; Bobbie
rescued it adroitly, and returning chased Miss Bell as far as
Goswell Road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hit me,&rdquo; she begged, panting;
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time&rsquo;s come,&rdquo; said the boy hotly,
&ldquo;when I&rsquo;ve got to punch your bloomin&rsquo;
&rsquo;ead for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>&ldquo;Lemme off this time,&rdquo; craved Miss Bell,
crouching against a shop window, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll stand you
a ride back by tram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t got no tuppence,&rdquo; said Bobbie,
relenting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got thruppence,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>They walked on as far as Bloomsbury in order that they might
have full money&rsquo;s worth.&nbsp; When they boarded a
departing tram, and the conductor shouted to them to get off, it
delighted Bobbie very much to be able to confound the man by
declaring themselves as passengers.&nbsp; To do honour to the
occasion the boy rolled a cigarette, and, turning to a tall
spectacled young man on the seat behind them, borrowed a
match.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take two,&rdquo; said the tall young man.</p>
<p>As the tram sailed past the lighted shops in Theobald&rsquo;s
Road, Trixie passed the twopence furtively to her companion, who
paid the conductor with a lordly air, offering at the same time a
few criticisms on the conductor&rsquo;s appearance.&nbsp;
Presently the girl touched very lightly his hand and moved nearer
to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your &rsquo;ead off my shoulder,&rdquo; he
remarked brusquely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to tell you something,&rdquo; said Trixie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Needn&rsquo;t get so close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother says&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; said Bobbie, &ldquo;is the old cat still
alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother says that if you like to leave those people
what you&rsquo;re with now and come and work at our shop as a
errand boy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A errand boy,&rdquo; echoed Bobbie amazedly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Work at that bloomin&rsquo; &rsquo;ole in the
wall?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll give you eighteen-pence a week and see
that you &rsquo;ave good schooling, and arrange so that you grow
up respectable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobbie, recovering from his astonishment, placed his cigarette
on the seat in order that he might laugh without restraint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all the dam bits of cheek!&rdquo; he declared
exhaustedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make a lot of difference to you,&rdquo; said the wise
young woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t grow up respectable
you&rsquo;ll simply&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, respectable,&rdquo; said the amused boy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, you silly little ijiot, d&rsquo;you think I
don&rsquo;t know a trick worth fifty of that.&nbsp; I ain&rsquo;t
going to work for my bloomin&rsquo; livin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave a chance to if the police get
&rsquo;old of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that another one of your Mar&rsquo;s remarks?&nbsp;
&rsquo;Cause, if so, you tell her from me, that she&rsquo;s
a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get down &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; said Trixie
Bell.&nbsp; She interrupted the string of adjectives by rising;
there were tears in her eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is &rsquo;Oxton
Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can,&rdquo; said the boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
goin&rsquo; on to Shoreditch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish I&mdash;I hadn&rsquo;t met you now,&rdquo; she
said, with a catch in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let it &rsquo;appen again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never speak to you,&rdquo; sobbed Trixie
Bell, &ldquo;never no more in all my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best bit of news I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;eard for a
age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you expect&mdash;don&rsquo;t you expect me
ever to take notice of you in future, mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do,&rdquo; said Bobbie, &ldquo;I shall be under
the pineful necessity of knocking your &rsquo;ead clean
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goo&rsquo;-bye,&rdquo; said the girl hesitatingly.</p>
<p><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>&ldquo;Be slippy,&rdquo; said Bobbie.</p>
<p>The tall young man on the seat behind leaned forward as Trixie
Bell disappeared down the steps of the tram.&nbsp; He tapped
Bobbie on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You behaved rather discourteously, sir, to your fair
companion,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; said Bobbie, recklessly.&nbsp; &ldquo;All
of you manage my affairs!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t mind me!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll sit back and not do nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My excuse must be that we have met before.&nbsp; My
name is Myddleton West, and I was at an inquest
once&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the lady who has just gone engaged to you, may I
ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fear,&rdquo; said Bobbie, disdainfully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a bit gone on me, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp;
Perfect nuisance it is, if you ask me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Myddleton West, &ldquo;shows how
awkward Providence is.&nbsp; With some of us the case is exactly
the reverse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a lump better off without
&rsquo;em,&rdquo; said the boy sagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only want one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And one,&rdquo; said Bobbie, &ldquo;is sometimes one
too many.&nbsp; What are you doing in this quarter?&nbsp; Thought
you lived &rsquo;Olborn way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want the police station in Kingsland Road,&rdquo;
said the journalist.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have to see the inspector
about something.&nbsp; Do you know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I not?&rdquo; said Bobbie confidently.</p>
<p>They descended at the turbulent junction of roads near
Shoreditch Station, and the boy conducted Myddleton West along
the noisy crowded pavement of Kingsland Road, under the railway
arch towards the police station.&nbsp; Glancing down Drysdale
Street as he passed, Bobbie noticed Bat Miller near the gas-lamp
talking to Nose&rsquo;s sister; observed also in the shadow of
the arch Mrs. Bat Miller watching the scene, her face white and
her lips moving.&nbsp; As soon as he had shown Myddleton West the
entrance to the police station, and had received sixpence for his
pains, he hurried through to Hoxton Street, coming back into
Drysdale Street from that end.&nbsp; His intention had been to
witness the comedy that he assumed to be impending; to his great
regret, just as Mr. Bat Miller began to punch the dark young
woman affectionately, the young men who guarded Drysdale Street
from the ruthless invader suddenly appeared, led by Nose and by
Libbis, and the odds being about eight to one, drove him off with
furious threats.&nbsp; He went back to the police station in
order to complete the earning of his sixpence by reconducting
Myddleton West to the tram for Bloomsbury.&nbsp; Approaching the
station, on the steps of which plain clothes men were as usual
lounging, he saw Mrs. Bat Miller on the opposite side of the
roadway, her white apron over her head, beckoning to one of the
plain clothes men.&nbsp; Then she walked carelessly into Union
Street.&nbsp; The detective followed her.&nbsp; Bobbie slipped
across and stood in a doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; said the detective.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your little game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Thorpe,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bat Miller, panting.&nbsp;
She pressed one hand against her bodice and gasped for
breath.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you want&mdash;want to do a fair
cop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fair cop,&rdquo; said Mr. Thorpe, cheerfully,
&ldquo;would just now come in very handy.&nbsp; Who are the
parties?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s behaved like a wretch,&rdquo; said the young
woman breathlessly, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;d never &rsquo;are turned
on him.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m as striteforward a gel as ever breathed
in all &rsquo;Oxton, ain&rsquo;t I, Mr. Thorpe?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>&ldquo;No one more so,&rdquo; agreed the
detective.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name
of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else I could &rsquo;ave forgive him,&rdquo;
she said, trembling with passion.&nbsp; &ldquo;When we&rsquo;ve
been &rsquo;ard up and he&rsquo;s come &rsquo;ome with not a
penny in his pocket and me gone without dinner, did I
complain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course you didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he was put away for six months three year ago,
didn&rsquo;t I slave and keep myself to myself, and go and meet
him down at Wandsworth when he came out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No lady,&rdquo; conceded Mr. Thorpe, &ldquo;could have
done more.&nbsp; What is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he was laid up in the orsepital,&rdquo; she went
on fiercely, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t I go to see him every visiting
day and take him nuts and oranges and goodness knows what all,
and sit be his bedside for the hour together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the detective
impartially, &ldquo;what men are coming to.&nbsp; Where
are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then to go paying his attentions to
a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so loud!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She checked herself and looked round.&nbsp; Then she took the
lapel of Mr. Thorpe&rsquo;s coat and whispered.&nbsp; Bobbie
could not hear the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed the detective.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are
they both indoors now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they ain&rsquo;t you can wait for &rsquo;em,&rdquo;
she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will six men be enough d&rsquo;you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six &rsquo;ll be ample, Mr. Thorpe,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And if Miller shows fight, tell them not to be
afraid of knocking him about.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll do him good,
the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make a note of it,&rdquo; said Mr.
Thorpe.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to come with us, I
s&rsquo;pose?&nbsp; You&rsquo;d better not be seen
p&rsquo;raps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You leave me to look after meself,&rdquo; she
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come over and &rsquo;ave a cup of tea along with our
female searcher,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Thorpe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tea be &rsquo;anged,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
shall want something stronger than tea when my paddy&rsquo;s
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daresay we shall be able to get you a sovereign or two
for this job if you keep yourself quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your money,&rdquo; she cried angrily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;All I want is to be at the Sessions when he comes up and
to watch her face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobbie crept from his doorway.&nbsp; Once in Kingsland Road,
he flew along swiftly, slipping in and out of the crowd, and
jumping a linen basket, to the astonishment of the two women who
were carrying it.&nbsp; He scuttled through the dwarf posts and
down Ely Place, knocking over one or two children toddling about
in the way, and reaching the house so exhausted that he could
only just give the usual whistle at the key-hole.&nbsp; Mr. Leigh
opened the door, and seeing him took off the chain.&nbsp; The
boy, staggering into the dimly-lighted passage leaned against the
wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bat Miller in?&rdquo; he panted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the row?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Leigh
concernedly.&nbsp; Bobbie explained in a hurried, detached,
spasmodic way.&nbsp; Mr. Leigh took a pair of scissors from his
pocket, and, glancing at a slip of looking-glass, cut off the
whiskers which fringed his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the wife,&rdquo; said Mr. Leigh, quietly snipping,
&ldquo;to meet me at Brenchley, if she gets clear.&nbsp; Tell her
not to make no fuss.&rdquo;&nbsp; He took his overcoat from the
peg, and a cloth cap with ear flaps.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come straight
here &rsquo;ave you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>&ldquo;Like a bloomin&rsquo; arrer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look outside and see if they&rsquo;ve come up
yet,&rdquo; requested Mr. Leigh, tying the flaps of his cap under
his chin.&nbsp; &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want no bother or
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ely Place being clear at the Hoxton Street end, Mr. Leigh, his
head well down, went out of the doorway.&nbsp; He shook hands
with Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a capital boy,&rdquo; whispered Mr. Leigh,
approvingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d got anything smaller than
a tanner about me I&rsquo;d give it you.&nbsp; Be
good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobbie closed the door, and his heart fluttering, went
upstairs to the front bedroom.&nbsp; The Duchess was asleep,
dressed, on her bed; her high-heeled boots ludicrously
obtrusive.&nbsp; Bobbie aroused her and gave her the news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My old man&rsquo;s safe, then?&nbsp; What about Bat
Miller?&rdquo; she asked, sitting up, affrightedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must watch out of the winder,&rdquo; ordered
Bobbie.&nbsp; &ldquo;If he comes first we&rsquo;ll wave him to be
off; if he comes after they&rsquo;re &rsquo;ere he&rsquo;ll be
nabbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a &rsquo;ead on you,&rdquo; said the
Duchess, trembling, &ldquo;that would be a credit to a Prime
Minister.&nbsp; Come to the winder and&mdash;Let me &rsquo;old
your &rsquo;and, I&rsquo;m all of a shake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t touch us, can they?&rdquo; asked
Bobbie, stroking the woman&rsquo;s thin trembling wrist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope not,&rdquo; said the Duchess, nervously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But there, you never know what the law can do.&nbsp; Fancy
her turning nark jest through a fit of jealousy.&nbsp; Is that
Miller talking to one of the neighbours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Miller it was.&nbsp; Mr. Miller, chatting amiably with one
of the lady neighbours on the subject of flowers and how to rear
them; the lady neighbour being something of a horticulturist in
her way, possessing, as she did, in her garden plot, one sooty
shrub, a limp sunflower, and several dandelions.&nbsp; Mr. Miller
had just said something to the lady neighbour which had made her
laugh uproariously, when, chancing to look up, he saw the signals
of the Duchess and of Bobbie.&nbsp; His face took a note of
interrogation; they motioned to him to go away with all
despatch.&nbsp; Mr. Bat Miller crammed his hat over his head and
ran off blindly; so blindly indeed that, at the Kingsland Road
end of the place, he jumped into the arms of three overcoated men
led by Mr. Thorpe; escaping these, he was caught neatly by
uniformed policemen who were close behind.&nbsp; At the same
moment a similar force appeared at the Hoxton Street end of the
place.&nbsp; Bobbie and the Duchess held each other&rsquo;s hands
and went downstairs.&nbsp; The faint sound of a hymn came from
the closed door.</p>
<p>Three loud raps at the front door.&nbsp; Bobbie went along the
passage and opened it.&nbsp; Mr. Thorpe, with the other men; out
in the court a small interested crowd, the noise of windows being
thrown up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come about the white-washin&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked
Bobbie, innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take the chain off, me lad,&rdquo; said Mr. Thorpe,
with his foot inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men came into the dark passage and one of them flashed a
bull&rsquo;s-eye lantern around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father in?&rdquo; asked Mr. Thorpe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; answered the boy, &ldquo;he
isn&rsquo;t exactly in, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t be long, I daresay.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t wait, sir,&rdquo; said Bobbie
respectfully, &ldquo;if I was you.&nbsp; Fact is he&rsquo;s been
dead some years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man with the bull&rsquo;s-eye made the circle of light
dance to the bottom stair and discovered the Duchess.&nbsp;
Another went to the closed door of the back room and put his
shoulder against it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Mr. Thorpe, turning
from the boy impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your good
gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t ask me, fellow,&rdquo; replied the
Duchess, endeavouring to assume her accent of refinement with
some want of success.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you want him, I really
think the best thing you can do is to find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go upstairs, two of you,&rdquo; commanded Mr.
Thorpe.&nbsp; &ldquo;Two others give Baker a help with that
door.&nbsp; Someone look after this woman and the kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobbie, his shoulder gripped by a broad hand, watched with
interest.&nbsp; The door groaned complainingly for a moment or
two; then it gave way with so much suddenness that the two men
stumbled into the room.&nbsp; Between the figures of the men
Bobbie could see the room crowded in the manner of a workshop of
limited accommodation.&nbsp; A wooden bench stood against the
shuttered windows; the flare of a fire out of sight reddened the
untidy floor.&nbsp; On a table some circular moulds of plaster of
Paris; near, some coins with a tail of metal attached that gave
them an unconvincing appearance.&nbsp; Three pewter pots, half
melted on the edge of an iron sink.&nbsp; A small battery in the
corner, and at this seated the figure of a young man.&nbsp; The
figure looked round casually as&rsquo; the men entered, and
Bobbie caught sight of a face not pleasant to look upon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the Fright?&rdquo; whispered Bobbie to the
Duchess.&nbsp; The Duchess nodded and touched her forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tile loose!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The figure turned back to his work of plating, crooning his
hymn as though the interruption was not worthy of any special
notice.&nbsp; Then the door partially closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind my shoulder, please,&rdquo; said the Duchess
affectedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am minding it,&rdquo; said the detective
cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re no gentleman,&rdquo; declared the Duchess,
&ldquo;or you wouldn&rsquo;t behave to a lady in this
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was never what you may call a society man,&rdquo;
said the detective.&nbsp; &ldquo;You seem to have got a rare old
little snide factory here all to yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon!&rdquo; said the Duchess icily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carried on nice and quiet too, apparently.&nbsp; No
show, no display, no what you may call arrogance about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this person talking about, Bobbie, my
dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ast him,&rdquo; said Bobbie, his eyes fixed on the
partially-closed door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This your boy, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you addressing your conversation to me,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who does the kid belong to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This lad,&rdquo; said the Duchess, precisely,
&ldquo;is, I regret to say, an orphan.&nbsp; I took some interest
in his case, and my husband and myself have, so to speak, adopted
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll probably have to unadopt him,&rdquo;
said the detective.&nbsp; &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s got no relatives
the State will take him in hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s she?&rdquo; asked Bobbie, detaching his
interest from the back room.</p>
<p><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>&ldquo;The State&rsquo;s got a pretty decent-sized
family as it is,&rdquo; went on the man, &ldquo;and one extra
won&rsquo;t make much difference.&rdquo;&nbsp; His two colleagues
came downstairs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Anybody?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; The
two men replied not a soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then one of &rsquo;em&rsquo;s nipped off,&rdquo; said
the detective.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go and tell the sergeant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door re-opened as the men proceeded to obey.&nbsp; Between
two of Mr. Thorpe&rsquo;s assistants came the demented man, his
terrible face down; Bobbie was pulled back to allow them to
conduct him through the passage.&nbsp; Finding himself going at a
regular pace, he commenced to sing huskily a Moody and Sankey
hymn with a marching rhythm.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hold the gospel banner high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On to victory grand,<br />
Satan and his hosts defy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And shout for Danyul&rsquo;s band.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Bring the woman and the boy,&rdquo; ordered Mr.
Thorpe.&nbsp; &ldquo;And keep close round them.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s an awkward crowd outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The awkward crowd of Ely Place was not apparently ready to
carry its awkwardness to the point of interference with the
police.&nbsp; On the contrary, the crowd seemed anxious to show
some friendliness towards the plain clothes men, saying, Good
evening, Mr. Thorpe, sir; more work for you, I see.&nbsp; And how
are you, Mr. Baker? and how&rsquo;s that cold of yours getting
on, I wonder?&nbsp; Some of the men of Mr. Thorpe&rsquo;s
regiment remained in charge of the house; the others assisted in
conducting the three arrested people to the police station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, young man,&rdquo; said Myddleton West, at the
entrance.&nbsp; The crowd in Kingsland Road had swelled to the
number of hundreds, and West had to wait for their
departure.&nbsp; &ldquo;You in this affair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like it,&rdquo; said Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I do anything?&rdquo; asked the long young
journalist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your head shut,&rdquo; said the boy gruffly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want no one interfering with my
affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deplorable thing,&rdquo; remarked Myddleton West aside
to the sergeant, &ldquo;for a child like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Thorpe, &ldquo;not at
all.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve nabbed him just in time.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Events</span> occurred with a rapidity
that, in view of their importance, seemed to Bobbie frankly
indecorous.&nbsp; No sooner had he been placed between parallel
iron bars in a police court than he was whisked from the iron
bars, on the direction of a magistrate, who had a kindly manner
with children; after a brief week at the workhouse, looked after
by a burly inmate (known <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>to colleagues by the satirical name
of the Slogger), Bobbie found himself again carried off swiftly
to the court, where, when a number of cases had been heard in
which foreign gentlemen and foreign ladies told everything but
the truth, Bobbie was hurried in and directed to stand by the
side of the dock, an order that annoyed him because this was
clearly an attempt to treat him as though he were not a grown up
and a perfect criminal.&nbsp; In the rooms adjoining the court he
had seen Bat Miller, and Bat Miller had had opportunity of
mentioning that he was the only one who would get put away, and
that when he came out it would be his pleasurable duty to see
that Mrs. Bat Miller found herself repaid for all her
trouble.</p>
<p>Scarce had the boy taken up an attitude of &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
care&rdquo; at the side of the dock, and scarce had he commenced
to prepare a short remark of defiance for the benefit of Master
Ted Sullivan, the shooting youth (whom he saw at the back of the
court), when he found himself hustled out of the court by the
public door; on kicking the gaoler protestingly in leaving, the
gaoler boxed his ears, telling him that he would find somebody
outside to teach him manners.&nbsp; Outside, indeed, was an
official from the workhouse, who re-conducted him to the huge
building that threw out its wings in various directions at the
back of Ely Place, and there they had no sooner arrived than
Bobbie, being now the charge and ward of the guardians, found
himself added to a party of children made up of six boys and
seven girls (nearly all of them younger than himself), who were
carried away in charge of the Slogger and a grim, silent comrade
of the Slogger, to a London station that Bobbie knew, there to
take train for the parish schools which Wisdom, looking in some
years before at a meeting of the Guardians, had suggested.&nbsp;
All this rapidity of action made the boy extremely sulky; when
the Slogger, in workhouse uniform, offered him a few choice
flowers of advice culled from the spacious gardens of experience,
in the shape of hints on the way of living in the world at the
minimum of labour to yourself and the maximum of expense to other
people, Bobbie growled at the Slogger&rsquo;s well-meant counsel,
and would have found the journey away into Essex tedious but for
the fact that he heard a woman in the next compartment remark
that he possessed a bright little face.&nbsp; The compliment
saved him from depression, and made him put his cap straight.</p>
<p>Arrived at a country station, the small band of thin-faced
children marched out into the roadway in charge of the two
men.&nbsp; One of the youngest baby girls had just decided the
moment to be opportune for wailing, when they happened on a scene
that changed the attitude of everybody from the Slogger down to
the smallest boy in petticoats.&nbsp; The sight being new to
Bobbie, his interest and delight increased accordingly.&nbsp; The
Slogger seemed to have exercised enough energy at some period of
his life to have obtained certain information, and was in
consequence able to give the scene a title.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cirkiss!&rdquo; said the Slogger authoritatively.</p>
<p>A circus it was!&nbsp; Not one of your cheap affairs, mind, of
amateur monkeys and two dogs and a goat, but a real, complete,
elaborate, efficient circus, with just now its best artistes out
to give to the town bold advertisement of its coming performance
that afternoon.&nbsp; Four huge lumbering elephants strode along
deliberately, men on their backs directing them with the touch of
a stick; when an elephant lifted its trunk as though about to
play something, the girls in the crowd that lined the village
street shouted, &ldquo;Oh&mdash;ah!&rdquo; affrightedly, and
stepped back on the toes of people behind <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>them.&nbsp;
Came, too, dainty white miniature horses, decorated with
trappings and bells, and led by pages in such admirable costumes
that it seemed almost a pity the wearers had not bethought
themselves of shaving; handsome, proud, capering black horses
ridden by sedate matrons in riding habits, who, being applauded
by the lookers on, bowed graciously and touched their hats with
their whips, but who, on the suggestion being loudly offered by
Bobbie (now scarlet with excitement) that they should turn a
somersault, frowned and looked at the crowd with the air of
offended empresses.&nbsp; Piebald ponies, brown ponies, chestnut
ponies and grey ponies, and, when you were tired of ponies, a
gorgeous car with uniformed footmen walking soberly at its side,
and high up in this car a lady with a trident and golden helmet
and white robes, who gazed straight before her and sniffed a
little, and once unfortunately gave a sneeze that sent the golden
helmet a little awry, but who, despite these drawbacks (which, of
course, were no reflection on her moral worth), looked a very
fine and dignified figure of a woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s she supposed to be?&rdquo; asked
Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Britannier,&rdquo; said the Slogger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you mean,&rdquo; said Bobbie.</p>
<p>The small girl who had attempted to cry, and now beamed, asked
if the lady was related to the Britannia, Camden Town, and found
herself for her ignorance derided by the rest of the party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course not, you silly young silly,&rdquo; replied
Bobbie.&nbsp; &ldquo;Britannia represents the country, and
she&rsquo;s the kind of mother of us all.&nbsp; Ain&rsquo;t she,
Slogger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But s&rsquo;pose you ain&rsquo;t got a muvver?&rdquo;
said the small girl, thinking she had detected a flaw in the
argument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s jest where she comes in
useful,&rdquo; declared Bobbie.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it,
Slogger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a manner of speaking,&rdquo; acknowledged the
Slogger, cautiously, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two camels went by awkwardly, and Bobbie told the other
children an amazing anecdote concerning them, invented on the
spur of the moment; the performing dogs passed with ridiculous
frills round their necks and an appealing look in their eyes that
begged people not to laugh at them; more horses, with more
haughty ladies; at the end of all the crowd fell in and followed
the procession to the large canvas tent away on a triangle of
spare land.&nbsp; As the party from Hoxton continued their march
along the road to their destination, they seemed altogether
different from those children who had come down.&nbsp; Bobbie
sang.&nbsp; When they were clear of the town, two long pieces of
string were seen far away in the broad dusty road.&nbsp; Coming
near, the first piece of string proved to be a long procession of
scarlet Tam o&rsquo; Shanter capped girls; the second was found
to be made up of bright round-faced expectant boys in serviceable
suits, chosen in order to evade any appearance of a uniform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said the Slogger once more, &ldquo;and
watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they going?&rdquo; asked Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to the cirkiss,&rdquo; answered the Slogger.&nbsp;
&ldquo;These are only the best of &rsquo;em, though.&nbsp; The
others &rsquo;ave to stay behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d no business,&rdquo; said the boy darkly,
&ldquo;to make no distinction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take off your cap to the ladies in charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not me,&rdquo; said Bobbie.</p>
<p><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>&ldquo;Take it off, when I keep telling you,&rdquo;
ordered the Slogger anxiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll only get
me and yourself into a row.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only this once, then,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>
<p>The Tam o&rsquo; Shanter capped little women, as they marched
by the new arrivals, seemed much amused at the odd appearance of
certain of the new recruits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For two pins,&rdquo; said Bobbie threateningly, as he
noted this attitude, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d punch all their
bloomin&rsquo; &rsquo;eads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the string of boys came the interest appeared more
pronounced, and Bobbie, too, looked anxiously to see the kind of
men with whom he would in future live.&nbsp; He felt bound to
confess that they were rather a smart set of youngsters marching
along with a swing; good temper (for which the afternoon&rsquo;s
treat was partly responsible) written large on everyone&rsquo;s
face.&nbsp; One boy of the marching detachment, being distant
from the two or three teachers who were in charge, asked the
Slogger satirically whether he would take a bit of slate pencil
for the whole fourteen, and the Slogger having no reply, Bobbie
threw a stone that hit the satirical boy on the leg, causing him
to cry &ldquo;Wah!&rdquo;&nbsp; The boys having passed, the small
detachment from Hoxton marched on again, and presently they saw
away at the side of the road a long row of red-tiled houses going
into fields and nursery gardens, and giving to the flat country a
look of bright importance.&nbsp; The Slogger spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are,&rdquo; said the Slogger, pointing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s &rsquo;ome sweet &rsquo;ome for all you
kiddies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Slogger pulled a bell at the closed gateway, and on the
gate opening obediently, the Slogger, with his silent colleague,
entered the covered passage at the head of the fourteen
youngsters.&nbsp; Near the end of the covered passage, a genial
uniformed man met them, and saying, &ldquo;Hullo! hullo!
hullo!&rdquo; took from the Slogger a blue form, which appeared
to be a kind of bill of lading, and checked the goods carefully;
then a stout motherly woman bustled out of the house, which was
the first, it seemed, of the many red-tiled houses that strolled
away into the meadows, and asked, &ldquo;Have you wiped your
boots, me dears?&rdquo; and when they answered in a shy chorus,
&ldquo;Yus!&rdquo; bade them wipe them again, a precaution
justified in view of the spotless floors and well-swept passages
which they presently found inside.&nbsp; The Slogger and his
colleague had a glass of beer and some bread and cheese, and then
the Slogger said &ldquo;Good-bye and good luck!&rdquo; his silent
companion whispered with a mysterious air to Bobbie, &ldquo;Long
live Enarchy!&rdquo; and they went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said the uniformed gate-keeper, taking
off his jacket, &ldquo;now to bath one or two of you biggest
boys.&nbsp; S&rsquo;phia, pick out yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wife of the uniformed man selected the girls and three of
the tiniest boys, and led them away to a separate bath-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Alf a sec.,&rdquo; said Bobbie,
protestingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a good wash once this
week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once isn&rsquo;t often,&rdquo; remarked the uniformed
man, opening the door of the bath-room.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
find that you&rsquo;ll not only have to wash regular, but
you&rsquo;ll get a proper bath twice a week, besides learning to
swim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s carrying a &rsquo;obby to an excess,&rdquo;
growled Bobby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go in!&rdquo; ordered the man.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
see to you first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That be &rsquo;anged for a tale,&rdquo; remarked the
boy, doggedly.</p>
<p>For answer, Bobby found himself shot swiftly into the
bath-room.</p>
<p><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>&ldquo;You begin to argue,&rdquo; said the man, not
unkindly, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll get into trouble: you do what
you&rsquo;re told, and you&rsquo;ll find yourself as right as
rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the lesson that Bobbie at first obstinately declined
to learn.&nbsp; The cottage was the probationary cottage where
all new comers stayed in quarantine for fourteen days, with every
day a visit from the doctor; the restraint and the regularity and
the cleanliness and the general order of the place were foes
against which Bobbie warred fiercely.&nbsp; He would have been
more antagonistic at this stage, only that the doorkeeper&rsquo;s
wife was a good, burly soul, with a heart as large as her hand
(both were easily moved), and when one day of the fortnight she
saw Bobbie comforting the small crying girl who had arrived with
the detachment, by standing on his head and clapping his heels to
a martial rhythm, in order that the child might be induced to
change tears for laughter, and when on charging Bobbie with being
a good boy to thus divert the weeping young lady, he furiously
denied the imputation, then the good woman determined that there
was good in Bobbie, and rewarded him with a special meat pasty
that the boy could not, in justice to his appetite, refuse.&nbsp;
Furtively, too, he made admirable dolls from young turnips which
had been brought in with others from the large gardens at the
back, and had been cast aside; one of these&mdash;a staring
damsel, with two peas for eyes, and a broad bean for a
nose&mdash;so much endeared itself to the heart of the lachrymose
little girl that, one evening, in an excess of emotion, she ate
it, afterwards crying her little heart out with remorse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, young Lancaster,&rdquo; said the doorkeeper,
looking in the bathroom at the end of a fortnight that seemed
about two years, &ldquo;now you&rsquo;ll on with your clothes and
come along o&rsquo; me to Collingwood Cottage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very near time, too,&rdquo; said Bobbie, rubbing
himself with the towel.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough of
this blooming bath nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, you haven&rsquo;t, my lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel,&rdquo; grumbled the boy, &ldquo;as though I
never want to wash again.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s my weskit,
boss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your manners?&rdquo; demanded the
doorkeeper sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trouble about manners,&rdquo; said
Bobbie; &ldquo;people &rsquo;ave to take me as they find
me.&nbsp; If they don&rsquo;t like it, they can jolly well lump
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll lump you if you are not careful,&rdquo;
warned the doorkeeper.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rub your head again with the
towel, and look sharp about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll look silly if they come interferin&rsquo;
&rsquo;long o&rsquo; me,&rdquo; said Bobbie, with the towel over
his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t like a kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are,&rdquo; said the man sagely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not only have you got a great deal to learn, but,
moreover, you&rsquo;ve got a great deal to forget.&nbsp; And
touching this bath business, that you seem to kick against so,
p&rsquo;raps you&rsquo;ll be interested to hear that in
Collingwood you&rsquo;ll have to wash just as regular as
you&rsquo;ve washed here, and you&rsquo;ll get your two baths a
week without fail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; said the boy, uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you the truth, my lad.&nbsp; Your
foster-parents &rsquo;ll see to that.&nbsp; Your new father works
in the carpenter&rsquo;s shop, and he&rsquo;s what you may call a
hard man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he comes the hard business with me,&rdquo; muttered
the boy, truculently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll dam well show
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was presently, after a kiss from the wife, which he
received shamefacedly, conducted out into the broad, gravelled
roadway dividing the two <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>rows of red-roofed cottages; stop
made at a clematis-covered house which bore its title over the
doorway.&nbsp; There his new foster-mother appeared and eyed him
critically, looked with great care at his head and eyes, and the
hour being in school-time and the cottage therefore without
family, she took him over the rooms, showing him with pride the
prints from Christmas numbers on the walls, the white-floored,
white-tabled dining-room, the comfortable sitting-room with its
illustrated weekly papers, and the kitchen and scullery, where
everything shone so that mirrors would have been a superfluity;
afterwards up the broad staircase to the dormitories, each with
seven red-counterpaned beds, and a floor that gave promise of
some day disappearing entirely under the attacks of scrubbing
from two long boys on their knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And some day,&rdquo; said the foster-mother,
generously, &ldquo;if you grow up a good boy and become a
half-timer, you shall be one of the two lads to stay at home and
help me with the &rsquo;ouse work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No great catch,&rdquo; remarked Bobbie, grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the foster-mother, &ldquo;you think so
now; but you wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gels&rsquo; work, not
men&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave girls in Collingwood,&rdquo;
said his foster-mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good job too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so I expect my boys to give me all the help about
the house that they can, you see.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll be back
from school and the workshops presently, and then you&rsquo;ll
meet &rsquo;em all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be a treat,&rdquo; said the boy,
satirically.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll call me &lsquo;mother,&rsquo; and
you&rsquo;ll call my &rsquo;usband
&rsquo;father.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got some brawsted silly notions down &rsquo;ere,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Use a word like that again, my boy,&rdquo; said his
foster-mother, with severity, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave
rice instead of meat for dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo; asked the boy, astonished.&nbsp; The
foster-mother spelt the word.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not say
brawsted,&rdquo; echoed Bobbie, amazedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, what
can you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Limitations of speech afflicted Bobbie sorely when the thirty
boys trooped into Collingwood from school and from work, jostling
him as they took their places at the dinner-table.&nbsp; He had
become so accustomed to the use of expressive words, here
tabooed, that it was not easy for him to find effective
substitutes.&nbsp; The boys aggravated him, too, by the
excellence of their spirits; to look at them and to hear them
talk, one would imagine this to be the brightest and cheeriest
spot on earth; Bobbie made up his mind to correct this want of
balance by surly and (when opportunity should offer) aggressive
behaviour.&nbsp; He sat at the table gloomily, and when the
foster-father, who brought to the dining-room a scent of
shavings, rallied him, making a mild joke upon his Christian name
(affecting to mistake Bobbie for a City policeman), the boy
declined to join in the laugh, and scowled persistently.</p>
<p>Later, at the large school-house over the way, he found
himself exposed to another ordeal, one that he decided in his
small brain to be nothing more nor less than a studied insult,
and this was an examination in spelling, reading, and arithmetic,
from which he emerged with a self-abasement equalled by
indignation against the young assistant teacher who had had to
put questions to him.&nbsp; Thanks to the care that he had always
taken to evade education offered by the State, he found himself
placed in a class at the end of the large school-room amongst
boys who were all some years <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>his junior; found himself, too,
failing to jump difficulties which they cleared with comparative
ease, and becoming in consequence the recipient of much
satire.&nbsp; After a few weeks of consideration, he decided one
morning, as he put his head under the shower-tap in the
washing-room at Collingwood&mdash;he had begun to conquer his
disinclination for cleanliness&mdash;that he would show everybody
he was not of the stuff that butts were made; that he would apply
himself seriously to the acquirement of knowledge.&nbsp; This
fact being made apparent, the young assistant found another
target for his shafts of satire, and when one afternoon the
question of 7 times 7 minus 9 was put to Bobbie, and the class
prepared to be exceedingly diverted at Bobbie&rsquo;s answer and
was so diverted, not recognizing the fact that his answer proved
absolutely correct, then the class had to be admonished for
inappropriate hilarity, in terms that made Bobbie&rsquo;s little
head swell with content.&nbsp; Being advanced to the next of the
three classes in the large school-room, he had maps to wrestle
with, and felt for a time a grievance against his country because
it had possessions in so many quarters of the globe.</p>
<p>Late afternoon brought relief in the shape of drill on the
large square space at the end of all the cottages and near to
meadows; drill conducted by an upright ex-army man in braided
uniform, who doubled the parts of a stern disciplinarian of a
drill-master, and a genial distributor of goods as a
storekeeper.&nbsp; On parade the drill-master was like a
commander-in-chief (but less hampered than that official by
Secretaries of State for War and people); there came exercise
with Indian clubs to the music of a band of boys in uniform of
blue with scarlet facings, so that at a distance you might think
they belonged to the service, and who were sometimes so proud of
their ability that they could scarcely play the brass
instruments; real military drill with small wooden rifles, and
once the awkwardness of the first few drillings passed, and once
you became used to the drillmaster&rsquo;s voice, it was capital
sport, because you had only to give imagination rein and you were
a grown-up lifeguardsman with an admirable chest, chin well up,
six feet two inches in your boots, and all the ladies who lived
downstairs in West End houses hard at work worshipping you.&nbsp;
Later, at five o&rsquo;clock (the time being late autumn), you
met the drill-sergeant again in the gymnasium, which was the
swimming bath boarded over, and there you had the rarest games
with parallel bars and the vaulting horse and horizontal bars,
and goodness alone knew what.&nbsp; When all this had gone on for
a few months Bobbie found to his great satisfaction that in
stretching out his right arm and then bringing his fist back
towards the shoulder there appeared above the elbow a distinct,
palpable, unmistakable, not to be denied, sign of thick
muscle.&nbsp; Saying his prayers that night on the reminder of
the monitor of his room, he omitted the formula that he had been
obliged to learn, and substituted special thanks for this
development, asking that he might become a strong man, so that he
could knock anybody down whenever that act should appear
appropriate and desirable.</p>
<p>Thus Robert Lancaster grew.</p>
<h2><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> days in general resembled each
other at the Cottage Homes, but there were exceptions.&nbsp; For
instance, Bank Holidays.&nbsp; On the first Bank Holiday after
the winter, came to the homes long, awkward young men who had
been boys, caught years since in the streets of Shoreditch, and
transferred (as Bobbie had been transferred) and educated and
trained, and who being now plutocrats in the enjoyment of
twenty-five shillings a week, or bandsmen capable of blowing
agreeable airs in military bands, or wide-trousered sailors with
a roll in their walk and brown open throats; these came to
re-visit the place that had made men of them, and to salute
respectfully admiring foster-parents, saying, Yes, thank you,
mother, I&rsquo;m getting along middling, thanks, mustn&rsquo;t
grumble, I s&rsquo;pose, and how are you, and how&rsquo;s
father?&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ve took the liberty, mother, which I
trust you&rsquo;ll excuse, of bringing you my photograph, which I
hope you&rsquo;ll accept with my best compliments.&nbsp; The
foster-mother having been duly ecstatic over the photograph,
(&ldquo;Your nose has come out so well, boy, that&rsquo;s what I
like about it&rdquo;), there would be tea in the dining-room with
some of the present boarders standing around open-eyed and
open-mouthed, whilst the young man told mother amusing anecdotes
of his present occupation, and fenced mother&rsquo;s delicate
inquiries concerning the whereabouts of his heart.&nbsp; It was a
proud young man who, the boys being ordered from the room, could
bring from the breast pocket of his coat a cabinet-sized picture
of an elegant young woman standing by a rustic gate with an open
book in her hand (this to show that in her, literature had a
friend) and an unconscious but slightly anxious look on her face
as who should say, &ldquo;Oh dear, dear, dear, I do hope nobody
is photographing me,&rdquo; and to announce that this was his
own, his very own young lady.&nbsp; The cottage having been
visited, there were nurses to call upon in the detached houses in
fields beyond the gate, and the masters of the school, and (with
great respect) the superintendent and his wife in their house,
and the doorkeeper and his wife in their cottage (&ldquo;My word,
I shall never forget the day I come here first&rdquo;), and
finally to light cigars in full view of the admiring boys and
depart.&nbsp; Also came friends of the boys or their more or less
unfortunate parents; and these, the way from Hoxton being long
and places of refreshment by the way numerous, sometimes arrived
at the gates in such extravagant spirits that, to the bitter
sorrow of some expectant youngster within, they could not be
admitted.&nbsp; Bobbie on a certain Easter Monday was feeling
sick at the throat upon seeing other boys with friends around
them, when to him were announced two ladies&mdash;Mrs. Bell and
Miss Trixie Bell!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Bobbie,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Bell,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you look a treat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Bell was costumed in a manner which reflected credit not
only upon herself and her dressmaker, but also in some way upon
the boarder at the Cottage Homes whom she was visiting.&nbsp;
Beneath a heavy fur-bordered cloak Bobbie could not help noting
that Mrs. Bell was in blue satin; a broad band sparkling with
beads went around her ample waist.&nbsp; Her face, it is true,
had become scarlet from the exercise of walking, but this only
lent a further variety of colour to her general appearance; her
black bonnet escaped the charge of monotony by the presence of
deftly placed yellow roses in full bloom.&nbsp; Her daughter,
growing and already several <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>years older in manner than her
mother, was more demurely apparelled, and as she stood near her
mother she drew careful diagrams on the gravel with the end of
her parasol.&nbsp; Glancing at her, it occurred to Bobbie for the
first time that Trixie Bell would become rather a fine young
woman when Time had lent further aid; she was neatly gloved, her
shoes were beyond criticism.&nbsp; One of the duties that had
come with years was, it appeared, to pilot her mother, and to
warn her when natural exuberance caused that good woman to
approach those rocks which, in speech, cause disaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw such a difference in all my life,&rdquo;
declared Mrs. Bell.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, you &rsquo;aven&rsquo;t
been here a couple of years and your hands are as clean as
clean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you getting on, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; he asked
civilly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Still in that little place in Pimlico
Walk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me and mother,&rdquo; interposed Miss Bell,
&ldquo;think of taking a business now in the Kingsland
Road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, ho!&rdquo; said Bobbie, &ldquo;mixing with the
upper ten, aye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;aven&rsquo;t got reely used to the idea
yet,&rdquo; confessed Mrs. Bell.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall miss the
smell of the fried fish shop at the end dreadfully.&nbsp; When
the wind is in the east it is quite a &rsquo;earty meal merely to
look out of the doorway and sniff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better find somewhere to sit down,
mother,&rdquo; said her daughter, severely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could do with a chair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come into my cottage,&rdquo; said Bobbie, with
pride.&nbsp; &ldquo;This way!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll introduce you to
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Bell, as they walked
along the broad space between the lines of cottages, &ldquo;that
I&rsquo;d no idea you were so comfortable.&nbsp; I thought they
was always thrashing of you at these schools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not always,&rdquo; said Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And fed you on brimstone and treacle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re thinking of the old days, mother,&rdquo;
said Trixie.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all been altered since your
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not, mind you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bell, &ldquo;that I was
a charity gel.&nbsp; Such education as I had was got at a very
high-class school off the &rsquo;Ackney Road, where you had to
pay your threepence a week, and where the
head-mistress&mdash;unfortunately she&rsquo;d no roof to her
mouth&mdash;had once upon a time been lady&rsquo;s maid in a very
good family indeed.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m
perfect,&rdquo; argued the lady, &ldquo;but the stigmer of being
a charity&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look where you&rsquo;re going, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; said Bobbie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just go first and see if you can come
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not only could they go in, but they did go in, and Mrs.
Bell&rsquo;s astonishment at the cleanliness of the place was so
frank and so genuine that the Collingwood mother instantly unbent
from a rigid attitude of defence and took Mrs. Bell into the
sitting-room, where over a strong cup of tea that extorted from
Mrs. Bell (her be-rosed bonnet untied and the cloak loosened)
further compliments, the two ladies discussed new soaps as
opposed to what they called elbow grease, and found common ground
in applauding the manners of thirty years ago.&nbsp; Bobbie and
Miss Trixie Bell, thus released from attendance, strolled round
the gardens, where Bobbie showed the <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>young woman his special plot, and
gave her, <i>comme souvenir</i>, a potato, which owed its
existence and growth to his efforts.&nbsp; He took her to see the
small room near the school, where the band practised, and
confided to her his aspirations in regard to the cornet.&nbsp; On
Trixie desiring, with some diffidence, to know what Bobbie
proposed to be when he should arrive at manhood, he replied,
&ldquo;A sailor, very like,&rdquo; and Miss Bell instantly
expressed her disapproval on the ground that occupation at sea
took a man from his home to an extent that was scarcely
convenient.&nbsp; Bobbie acknowledged that he had not at present
made up his mind definitely, and that perhaps after all he should
come back to Hoxton and dodge about and pick up a living somehow,
but this plan also found disfavour in the young woman&rsquo;s
eyes, and she argued against it with much force and eloquence
until Bobbie felt bound to interfere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what,&rdquo; he said brusquely, &ldquo;I shall
do jest what I jolly well like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning to Collingwood after this heated debate, the two
appeared rather silent, and when a long red-haired girl nodded
from the other side of the way to Bobbie, Miss Bell inquired
curtly concerning her, to which Bobbie replied frivolously and
incorrectly that her name was Montmorency, speaking of her as the
lady to whom he was engaged to be married; the facts being that
her name was Nutler, and that he and the ruddy-haired young lady
had not yet exchanged a word with each other.&nbsp; Mrs. Bell
found herself borne off by her perturbed daughter in the middle
of an interesting description of the manner in which she lost Mr.
Bell, and at the gates the good soul kissed Bobbie and gave him a
shilling; the while Miss Bell walked off and assumed a languid
interest in a mail cart belonging to an infant boarder.&nbsp;
Bobbie touched his cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my belief, Trixie,&rdquo; declared Mrs.
Bell, before she was out of hearing, &ldquo;that he&rsquo;ll grow
up a perfect gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, will he?&rdquo; said Bobbie to himself, with great
artfulness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shows how much she knows about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Occasions</span> when the boy allowed
himself an outburst of rebellion became more rare as he felt his
way slowly up the school-room to the height of the third
standard; the Collingwood mother found herself able one day to
congratulate him on the fact that for two months he had not
imperilled his right to a meat dinner.&nbsp; Excellence of table
proved, indeed, with all the boys in the Cottage Homes a powerful
incentive to good behaviour.&nbsp; The bill of fare changed every
day; boiled beef and carrots on (say) Thursday were followed by
roast mutton on Friday and by Irish stew on Saturday, with a
precise allowance to each cottage (a restriction which did not
apply to vegetables), so that meals had, by reason of this
variety, a charm of unexpectedness which pleased the boys
greatly.&nbsp; In their own homes in Hoxton most of them had only
been sure of two things in regard to dinner&mdash;either that
there would not be enough, or that there would be none at
all.&nbsp; <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>Thus it was that when appeals to a boy&rsquo;s sense of
honour or his sense of decorum failed, an appeal to his appetite
proved effective.&nbsp; With Bobbie, moreover, there was ever, as
a high goal to be strived for, the band.&nbsp; With the
assistance of a good-natured euphonium who lived in Collingwood,
and after much wrestling with obstinate difficulties, the
knowledge that F.A.C.E. spelt the open spaces became his proud
possession; other musical facts capitulated on seeing his
determination.&nbsp; Whenever tempted to punch another
boy&rsquo;s head, and roll that boy on the asphalted space where
they played during the ten minutes&rsquo; relief from school, and
to tear that boy&rsquo;s pocket, and to do him grievous damage,
the thought of himself marching in the band uniform and blowing
the cornet part of the &ldquo;Turkish Patrol&rdquo; arrested his
hand; the same thought did him the same good service when, on
being sent to the store-keeper&rsquo;s room, he found himself
near to an open drawer containing sugar and chocolate.&nbsp; At
times, however, temper burst so suddenly that there was no time
for the thought of cornet to intervene, and then the possibility
of being allowed to join the band went away so far as to be
nearly out of sight, and Bobbie mourned.&nbsp; On one of these
grey days he happened to be despatched to the bandmaster with a
note.&nbsp; The bandmaster was rehearsing the overture to
&ldquo;Zampa&rdquo; in the small room overfilled with noise by
twenty lads, who had become scarlet-faced from the tension of
watching the slips of music before them, of watching, also, the
bandmaster&rsquo;s beat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Pon my word,&rdquo; cried the bandmaster
explosively, rapping the stand before him with his stick, and
stopping the brazen blasts that had made windows shake, &ldquo;if
you cornets aren&rsquo;t enough to make a saint forget
himself.&nbsp; What do you think you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cornets, with respect, replied that they thought they were
playing a tune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should never have guessed that,&rdquo; retorted the
bandmaster caustically.&nbsp; Bobbie delivered his note.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What you&rsquo;ll be like if you go out anywhere to play
this summer don&rsquo;t bear thinking about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the cornets offered the remark that he was doing his
best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And bad&rsquo;s your best,&rdquo; cried the bandmaster
explosively.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;d guarantee to take a
piece of wood and make it play the cornet better than you do,
Nutler.&rdquo;&nbsp; The cornet player, Nutler, here chuckled
under the impression that the bandmaster required laughter in
recognition of the humour of the remark.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
laugh at me, sir,&rdquo; ordered the bandmaster violently.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nutler, the
cornet-player, assumed a look of abject woe.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
don&rsquo;t look like that, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Nutler, goaded, inquired resentfully how he was to
look, then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re to look smart, sir,&rdquo; said the
bandmaster, &ldquo;if you want to continue in the band.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s plenty of others, mind you, ready to take your
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Nutler muttered the disastrous remark that they would
take a bit of finding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the bandmaster, &ldquo;would they take
a bit of finding?&rdquo;&nbsp; He called to Bobbie, now leaving
the room.&nbsp; &ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; he cried out, &ldquo;come
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobbie returned and saluted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any ear for music?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How d&rsquo;you mean ear, sir?&rdquo; asked Bobbie
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you sing?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll you &rsquo;ave, sir?&rdquo; said
Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy, round-eyed with eagerness, sang a few lines of an
amiable glee which Collingwood boarders were accustomed to
chant.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re gowing to the woodlands, to the
woodlands gay and free.<br />
Now, who will be my comrade and come along with me?<br />
For I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; said the bandmaster.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you think you could play a musical
instrument?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I could try, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&nbsp; You come to elementary practice this
evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Bobbie, flushing
delightedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Clever Nutler,&rdquo; remarked the bandmaster
acutely to the cornet boy, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll see who&rsquo;s
right&mdash;you or me.&nbsp; Come along.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s try
this second part again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Nutler whispered to Bobbie as he went by that for two
pins he would wring Bobbie&rsquo;s something neck, but the two
pins not being forthcoming Master Nutler did not carry his threat
into effect.&nbsp; Bobbie went out of the room, and as he walked
by the side of the garden could not help noticing how much
brighter the sun appeared, and how very excellent was the
world.&nbsp; He grew so ecstatic over the prospect of becoming a
man of importance that he wrote in the evening to the Duchess at
the address given to him two years before, a letter which seemed
to him to err, if anything, on the side of modesty.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear
Duches</span>,&mdash;I am writing a few lines to hope that you
and Mr. Leigh are quite well and getting on fine.&nbsp; I have
not seen you for a long pereod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am pleased to tell you that I am principle player in
the band here, and much esteemed by my masters and by my fellow
scolars.&nbsp; Everybody says I shall make one of the finest
music players in the world if I only go on and succede.&nbsp;
Dear Duches, I think sometimes of the old days, but not often,
because I am so busy with my music.&nbsp; I am an accomplished
scolar and a cr. to the schools.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you ever come to London you can come and see me, but
dress nice, and do not say nothing about Ely Place and Mr.
Miller.&nbsp; I am in compond division.&nbsp; Remember me to Mr.
Leigh, and I remain,&mdash;Yours truly,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Robert
Lancaster</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall probably play at the Flower Show in
Augst.&nbsp; They all say the band will be nothing without
me.&nbsp; I am now twelve years next birthday, which will be also
in Augst.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Robert Lancaster took so much care in regard to behaviour
after his first lesson on the cornet, and walked about with such
a detached important air that the Collingwood mother insisted on
giving him medicine under the impression that his health could
not be perfect.&nbsp; An outburst of temper reassured the good
lady, but general improvement was a passport that enabled Bobbie
to enter the gates of her matronly reserve, and she singled him
out for favour by telling him about her youth in Devonshire;
memories that helped to revive Bobbie&rsquo;s thoughts of his one
gay spell of hop-picking years ago in Kent.&nbsp; The Collingwood
mother, having been away from her <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>native county for twenty years, gave
idealistic descriptions of Torrington, and Milton Damerel, and
Brandis Corner, so that the country generally became pictured in
his mind as a land of fair delight.&nbsp; When
Collingwood&rsquo;s mother shook her head in despair at being
unable to describe the joys more fully, Bobbie would brag about
Hoxton and the Haberdashers&rsquo; School at the end of Pitfield
Street, with its statue of Aske and its tall iron railings.&nbsp;
Somehow the more he talked of the place the less inclined be felt
to return there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak to me about your Hoxtons,&rdquo;
begged the Collingwood mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give me decent people
to mix with that know how to wash &rsquo;emselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re pretty smart up there,&rdquo; urged
Bobbie, with deference.&nbsp; &ldquo;They know a thing or
two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They know a thing or two too many,&rdquo; declared the
Collingwood mother, severely.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose
you&rsquo;ve ever come across the worst of &rsquo;em, but
I&rsquo;m told there are thieves and coiners, and goodness knows
what all about the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think it&rsquo;s a fact, mother?&rdquo; inquired Bobbie
with innocence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless you, yes.&nbsp; The lowest of the low.&nbsp;
Didn&rsquo;t you never come across any of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; echoed the boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Goo&rsquo;
gracious!&nbsp; What a question to ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you were too young to take notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might have been it,&rdquo; he conceded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Fact of the matter is my real mother was very careful who
she mixed with, and there might &rsquo;a been railway snatchers
or anything around us for all I knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about them,&rdquo; interrupted the
Collingwood mother, shivering.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me tell you some
more about Devonshire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Summer came to the Cottage Homes and brought with it cricket
matches to be played against the boys of the private school a few
meadows off, where the two different grades of young men met on
common ground that the best of games offers, and where Bobbie
developed an ability for bowling slows of a peculiarly artful and
delusive character, insomuch that they came from his hand in a
way that made the batter (confident of hitting a six-er) run out
to strike, with the result that he not infrequently found himself
bowled or stumped.&nbsp; These games with boys of happier
circumstances did much to refine the lads of the Cottage Homes;
even Bobbie, whilst he ridiculed and burlesqued some of the
private school youths who had a languid way of talking and a
courteous behaviour, found himself selecting some of the tricks
of manner that seemed to him worthy and commendable, and these
improved him.&nbsp; The cornet helped.</p>
<p>Rehearsals of the band became more furious as the day of the
Flower Show approached.&nbsp; Master Nutler by dint of successful
experiments in insubordination found his engagement for the event
in peril, and Master Nutler had more than once pressed Bobbie to
decide the question of their musical ability by a stand-up
fight.&nbsp; Quite a large family of Nutlers lived in the Homes,
ranging from the lanky, red-haired girl of fifteen to a baby of
two; the father and mother of the family having, on retirement to
an unknown quarter, generously presented their entire quiver-full
to the guardians as souvenir of indebtedness to their native
parish, so that a sample of the Nutler family could he found in
nearly every cottage and in the ophthalmic hospital beyond the
gates.&nbsp; The gauge of combat being thrown down repeatedly in
the presence of witnesses, Bobbie felt bound at <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>last to take
it up, and arrangements being effected by a mature boy, the fight
took place furtively in the kitchen garden one evening at
twilight; Bobbie punishing Master Nutler so effectively that he
had to give that weeping indignant young gentleman two glass
alleys, a china apple, and a copy of a book from the Index
Expurgatorius, in order to prevent him from saying anything about
it.&nbsp; Master Nutler, thus bribed, generously agreed not to
report the circumstance to the authorities, but he gave
information to the other members of his family, and commanded a
vendetta against Robert Lancaster.&nbsp; The Nutler family had
its private differences; indeed, its members seldom met without
quarrelling, but in the presence of an opportunity for spite
against a common enemy they united, and conferred amicably on a
course of action.&nbsp; The eldest Miss Nutler favoured
scratching of the enemy&rsquo;s face; after debate the others
induced her to withdraw this resolution, and to agree to a plan
of more elaborate strategy.</p>
<p>Gay expectation scented the air on the morning of the Flower
Show.&nbsp; For the band especially, it meant occupying on a
sunlit lawn a position of conspicuous importance, to be followed
by admirable feeding and iced lemonade that had no limits except
those fixed by the band&rsquo;s own capacity.&nbsp; It was an
occasion, too, when fair ladies came from mansions of the
neighbourhood and paid graceful compliments to the band,
sometimes giving to members bright, alluring pieces of
silver.&nbsp; Master Nutler, who had received intimation that,
owing to his want of care at rehearsals, his services would not
be required, when about muttering to himself in a gruff
undertone, as men will when they are suffering from repressed
grievances.&nbsp; At twelve o&rsquo;clock, after morning school,
the conscientious bandmaster took the boys through the devious
ways of the &ldquo;Il Trovatore&rdquo; selection, and piloted
them with the solo parts of &ldquo;H.M.S. Pinafore.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Bobbie&rsquo;s playing of his solo extorted from the bandmaster a
rare word of approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got on wonderfully well, Lancaster,&rdquo;
said the bandmaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks to you, sir,&rdquo; said the boy politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t quite so steady as I could wish, but I
think you&rsquo;ll pull through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You leave it to me,&rdquo; said Bobbie, rubbing the
cornet affectionately with his handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At two o&rsquo;clock, boys, we start.&nbsp; Take care
that none of you get into a mischief between now and
then.&rdquo;&nbsp; A chorus of assurances.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; sighed the bandmaster, &ldquo;I know what boys
are.&nbsp; Lancaster, can you take a note to the superintendent
for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a shot, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobbie, flying out into the asphalted playground to take the
note in the promised manner, found himself tripped up by Master
Nutler, who, having done this, demanded, with great indignation,
to know where Bobbie was a-coming to.&nbsp; Bobbie replied that
some day, when he could afford it, he proposed to enjoy the
pleasure of again wiping the floor with Nutler, whereupon that
young gentleman requested that the task should not be postponed,
but should be effected at once.&nbsp; Bobbie forced himself into
composure, and hurried on, followed by a parting remark from
Nutler, &ldquo;Sneak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trotting along by the fringe of flower beds on the right-hand
side of the broad walk, in great good-humour, the scream of a
girl near to one of the red-roofed houses made him stop.&nbsp;
Lanky Miss Nutler, having seen him approach, had twisted the arm
of the small girl who, two years previously, <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>had arrived
at the Homes with Bobbie, and who, having long since given up
tears, had become one of the brightest little maids in the
place.&nbsp; At present, however, she appeared terrified out of
her usual cheerfulness because of superfluous attention paid to
her by Miss Nutler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now will you be good?&rdquo; inquired Miss Nutler,
suavely, as she gave the small girl&rsquo;s arm another
twist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am good,&rdquo; cried the small girl piteously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Leave off twistin&rsquo; my wrist, or else I shall have to
scream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Promise not to call me Miss Camel again,&rdquo; ordered
the lanky young woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall punish you,&rdquo; said Miss Nutler, with
regret, &ldquo;more for telling a lie than for calling me out of
my proper name.&rdquo;&nbsp; The small girl screamed with
pain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah! you may &rsquo;oller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave the girl alone,&rdquo; shouted Bobbie from the
fence of the garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg your pardon?&rdquo; said Miss Nutler, with studied
courtesy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t quite catch what you
said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave that little girl alone,&rdquo; he repeated
sharply.&nbsp; &ldquo;If she&rsquo;s done anything wrong,
it&rsquo;s for others to punish her, not you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to &rsquo;old any conversation with
you,&rdquo; said the young woman sedately.&nbsp; &ldquo;Kindly
mind your own business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leggo my wrist,&rdquo; cried the small girl
agonizedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come and make her, Bobbie
Lancaster.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll&mdash;she&rsquo;ll break my
arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Lancaster darted through the gates.&nbsp; The small
girl&rsquo;s face was white with pain; Miss Nutler&rsquo;s face
yellow with defiance.&nbsp; He released the small girl quickly,
and she ran off.&nbsp; Miss Nutler staggered hack, and fell, an
ungraceful heap, on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Elp! &rsquo;Elp! Murder!&rdquo; yelled Miss
Nutler.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fi&mdash;yer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what are you kicking up a row for?&rdquo; demanded
Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s killed me,&rdquo; declared Miss Nutler,
panting, to the mother of her cottage, who had hastened out to
ascertain the cause of disturbance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, the
villain!&nbsp; Oh, fetch a doctor!&nbsp; Oh, don&rsquo;t let him
make his escape!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to make no escape,&rdquo; said the
boy sturdily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never knocked her down; she fell
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Miss Nutler.&nbsp; &ldquo;To think
that he should tell a untruth.&nbsp; Oh, I wonder he ain&rsquo;t
struck down before my very eyes!&nbsp; Oh, I&rsquo;m going into
&rsquo;sterricks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she went off into what, it must be admitted, was, for a
young amateur, a very fair imitation of a hysterical fit.</p>
<p>The mother, much concerned, told Bobbie that he would have to
be taken at once to the Superintendent.&nbsp; The father of a
cottage opposite appeared.&nbsp; Interference by boys with girls,
said the father, was just the one thing that had to be punished
for more than anything.&nbsp; Could not be permitted for a single
moment&mdash;not for a single moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s anyone to do,&rdquo; stammered the
boy, indignantly, &ldquo;when they see a big girl like her
ill-using another &rsquo;alf her size?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father said that it was not for Bobbie to interfere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I simply separated of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; pleaded the
boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;She was using the little girl something crool,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perjerer!&rdquo; interrupted Miss Nutler, reviving for
this purpose.&nbsp; She closed her eyes again, and hammered at
the ground with her heels.</p>
<p><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>&ldquo;And I particular don&rsquo;t want to get into no
trouble just now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll explain it all
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father said that to-morrow would not do.&nbsp; Bobbie must
go along with him now to the Superintendent&rsquo;s house, the
while the mother would use her best endeavours to restore Miss
Nutler.&nbsp; The latter task proved to be one of no difficulty,
for the young woman, on the palms of her hands being slapped,
re-opened her eyes, and said, faintly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where am I?&nbsp; Tell me, someone!&nbsp; Is it all a
&rsquo;orrible dream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Superintendent, ordinarily a cheery man, whistled gravely
as he listened to the report against the boy standing at the
other end of the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought you were a good lad, Lancaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much use being good, sir,&rdquo; growled Bobbie,
&ldquo;when your luck&rsquo;s against you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father, an old policeman, enjoying this echo of the old
days, repeated and added to his report of Miss Nutler&rsquo;s
condition, remarking sagely that extreme violence must have been
used.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll investigate it fully to-morrow,&rdquo;
commanded the Superintendent.&nbsp; &ldquo;No time now.&nbsp;
Meanwhile you&rsquo;ll stay at home, my lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Bobbie, amazedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
not play at the show?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And not play at the show.&nbsp; Some one else must be
found to take your place.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy swallowed something in his throat, and his under lip
twitched.&nbsp; He looked round at the framed list of rules on
the wall, at the papers on the table, and at everything in the
room with a dazed air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a&mdash;a bit sorry about it, too,&rdquo; he
said gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rules are rules,&rdquo; mentioned the
Superintendent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone shall suffer for it,&rdquo; declared the boy,
with sudden fierceness.&nbsp; &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t going to be
jumped on just because&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him down to Collingwood,&rdquo; ordered the
Superintendent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you give me a good wolloping, sir, and have
done with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him away, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a fierce and an aggrieved and a revengeful lad who
looked out of the window of Collingwood that afternoon and
watched the band marching out towards the gates, uniformed in its
best, and carrying its instruments proudly.&nbsp; The rays of the
bright sun reflected in the shining brass, and Robert Lancaster
blinked as he looked at them, but he did not cry, because, when
he saw Nutler marching with cornet in hand, his hot little brain
racked with a burning sense of injustice.&nbsp; He went upstairs
and watched the short line of boys until trees intervened.&nbsp;
He had some vague idea of breaking everything in the cottage that
could be broken, but a moment&rsquo;s consideration informed him
that this as a remedy would be imperfect.&nbsp; The mother called
to him, offering some work in cleaning the grate, and Bobbie,
setting to this with great strenuousness, produced such excellent
results that the mother gave him her sympathy for his present
situation, and joined him in denouncing Miss Nutler in good set
terms.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the grievance remained, and the mother
went so far in her cordial agreement that, after a while, the
grievance appeared to have grown enormously, and he felt himself
to be the very worst used man in the whole world.&nbsp;
Somebody&rsquo;s head should be punched for this; if he had Teddy
Sullivan&rsquo;s revolver, a more convincing action could be
adopted.&nbsp; It would be rather fine and dramatic to go out
when the band <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>returned and, covering them with a six-shooter, force
them to hold up their hands and give him full apology for the
wrong that had been done to him.&nbsp; Failing the presence of an
arm of warfare, it seemed not easy to see what he could do.&nbsp;
All that he could decide in his aggrieved, blazing, infuriated
mind was that he would do something.</p>
<p>When a post letter came at about four o&rsquo;clock addressed
to him in a strange old-fashioned writing, he did not at first
open it, because, rare as letters were, he felt gloomily that
nothing like good fortune could come to him on that day.&nbsp; He
tore the envelope after a while, and prepared himself for another
shaft of ill-luck.&nbsp; A postal order dropped out, and his
anticipations whirled round.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear
Bobbie</span>,&mdash;I were glad to hear from you, and to know
that you was getting on so well in the world.&nbsp; My husband
were also greatly pleased.&nbsp; He is now what is called a
landoner, and is much occupied during the day looking after the
men that is employed under him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Bobbie, you must know that we live in an immense
hotel, and that I ride to the hounds every day of my life.&nbsp;
We also intertain the gentry of the neighbourhood, who treat us
as their equals or more.&nbsp; We are not proud of our good
fortune, for we know that pride cometh before a fall.&nbsp; I
enclose a trifle to buy yourself something; I could easily send
more, as we are, so to speak, roling in money, but I am in a
hurry to catch the post.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My husband sends his best respects, and hopes you will
continue to grow up a good boy and respect your
elders.&mdash;Yours affect&rsquo;ly,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;L. <span
class="smcap">Leigh</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fond love and kisses.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bobbie read this friendly and agreeable letter from the
Duchess three times.&nbsp; Then, looking at the address
carefully, he started up with a sudden inspiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; he said to himself
excitedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bunk off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made his preparations with haste, having a vague fear that
something might happen to induce him to change his mind.&nbsp;
The mother of Collingwood Cottage was dozing in her kitchen as he
came downstairs, and he had a good mind to kiss the good soul;
but he knew that doing this might twist his determination, and he
set his mouth hard.&nbsp; He stuffed his small bundle under his
waistcoat, and went across to the band-room with the stolid face
of a man obeying orders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, I&rsquo;ve got to take my cornet and get down
to the Flower Show as sharp as I possibly can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same story contented the gate-keeper, who gave him the
correct time, and Bobbie started along the white road at a quick
pace.&nbsp; At the first turning he branched off, and, skirting
the fields belonging to the Cottage Homes, returned to the town,
where a post-office was to be found.&nbsp; There he changed the
postal order.&nbsp; In five minutes he was speeding away
Londonwards, with defiant head well out of the carriage windows,
a cigarette between his lips, the cornet and his handkerchiefed
bundle in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said the boy truculently to the distant
red-roofed homes, &ldquo;this&rsquo;ll let you see what a man can
do when he&rsquo;s put upon.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> confusing eddy of people
outside Liverpool Street Station startled him, so that he stood
back to let them go by, until he remembered that they did not
cease to flow before midnight, and then he laughed at himself and
made his way out into Bishopsgate.&nbsp; He had a fine sense of
freedom in the consciousness that he was his own master; within
wide limitations he could go where he pleased and do as he
pleased, and no one had the right to say him nay.&nbsp; It seemed
like getting rid of a suit of armour.&nbsp; He gave himself the
luxury of swearing softly as he walked along, in order to prove
conclusively that he was no longer trammelled by the code of
rules that obtained at the Cottage Homes.&nbsp; Walking up
towards Shoreditch Church it appeared to the boy that he was as
fine a fellow as any in the crowd of men hurrying along the
pavement, that his daring and his independence were sufficient
for about six ordinary men; he felt very much inclined to stop
one or two in order to tell them so.&nbsp; The better to live up
to his new character of a regular blade, he turned into the
saloon bar of a gorgeous, over-mirrored, over-painted,
over-furnished public-house, and addressing a superb young lady
who behind the bar read a pamphlet called &ldquo;An Amusing Way
to Pick up Biology,&rdquo; asked in a deep, effective voice for a
sherry and bitters.&nbsp; The superb young lady, seemingly dazed
with study, gave him instead a small bottle of lemonade and a
hard biscuit; Bobbie, awed by her appearance, did not dare to
complain of the mistake.&nbsp; He endeavoured, however, to entice
the large young woman into manly conversation by asking her how
long it was since she had left the old place, but she only
answered absently, without looking up from her hook,
&ldquo;Outside with those bootlaces, please,&rdquo; and Bobbie
refrained from repeating his question.</p>
<p>At the corner of Drysdale Street he met a first friend in the
person of Niedermann, otherwise Nose, grown ridiculously tall,
and garbed in a frock coat queerly short at the sleeves.&nbsp;
Niedermann did not know him at first, but when recognition came
he became at once interested, and asked a number of questions,
some of which Bobbie answered truthfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you ought to go and do, ole man,&rdquo; said
Niedermann, acutely, &ldquo;is to disguise yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How d&rsquo;you mean disguise myself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, put on a false beard,&rdquo; said the frock-coated
lad, &ldquo;and blue spectacles, and what not.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll
get copped else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t trouble,&rdquo; said the boy
uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take my advice or not, jest as you like.&nbsp; But I
know what I should do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely they&rsquo;re glad to get rid of me,&rdquo;
argued Bobbie.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a saving to them of
pounds a year, and besides&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what you could do,&rdquo; said Master
Niedermann, looking at him thoughtfully, &ldquo;and that too
without no trouble.&nbsp; You see this coat and weskit of
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what there&rsquo;s left of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swop!&rdquo; said the long youth walking with Bobbie
down towards the railway arch.&nbsp; &ldquo;These what I&rsquo;ve
got are a bit short for me, because I&rsquo;m a grown lad, as you
may see.&nbsp; But they&rsquo;ll suit you a treat, and, besides,
<a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>if they
circulate your description, no one in these togs &rsquo;ll
recognize you for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t see me if I was to get inside of
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re wrong,&rdquo; said Niedermann
patiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;What did you say the address was that
you&rsquo;ve run away from?&rdquo;&nbsp; Bobbie gave the
information.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no call to remember,&rdquo; said the boy
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I carry it all &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; said Master
Niedermann darkly, tapping his unwashed forehead; &ldquo;regular
store&rsquo;ouse of information my brain is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you call it a brain?&rdquo; asked
Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you particularly want your &rsquo;ead
punched?&rdquo; asked Master Niedermann fiercely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Because, if so, you&rsquo;ve only got to say the word,
and&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; He recovered himself with an
effort.&nbsp; &ldquo;But putting all argument a one side,&rdquo;
he said genially, &ldquo;you try on my coat and see how it
fits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Bobbie complying, Master Niedermann took no pains to
conceal his approval of the change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My word!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you might a been
measured for it by a West-End tailor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it a bit long in the tails?&rdquo; asked
Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the better for that,&rdquo; declared the long youth
with enthusiasm.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re wearing &rsquo;em
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now give me back my jacket,&rdquo; said Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That be &rsquo;anged for a tale,&rdquo; answered
Niedermann, with an injured expression.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
bargain&rsquo;s a bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this isn&rsquo;t a bargain,&rdquo; expostulated the
boy in the frock-coat.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never
said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said the long youth
threateningly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you want me to give you up to the
police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the interview with Master Niedermann Bobbie determined
to avoid friends for the rest of that evening.&nbsp; He therefore
walked about the streets of Hoxton, his cornet wrapped in a
newspaper under his arm, dodging when he saw a face known to
him.&nbsp; He glanced at himself on passing shop windows, and
tried to believe that the frayed frock-coat gave him an increased
air of manliness.&nbsp; Strolling cautiously into Pimlico Walk,
and inspecting the little bonnet shop kept by Eliza Bell, he saw
Trixie at the counter; her black hair rolled up and arranged
carefully above her pretty neck, she wore a pink blouse with neat
collar and cuffs, her face had a touch of colour, and Bobbie for
the first time felt that he would like to kiss her.&nbsp; He
knew, however, that to enter the shop of Mrs. Bell would
necessitate listening to reproof and good advice, neither of
which things was that evening desired by him.&nbsp; The same
motive stopped him from taking a &rsquo;bus to Fetter Lane to
call upon Myddleton West, whose address he remembered; he told
himself that he enjoyed liberty too much to allow it to be
checked by sage counsels.&nbsp; Going up to Ely Place and
turning, with some idea of going through in order to see the
house where he had spent some of his life, he had but passed the
dwarf posts at the entrance when at least six separate and
offensive odours rushed furiously at him.&nbsp; He coughed and
turned back.</p>
<p>But in the Theatre of Varieties he found joy.&nbsp; He paid a
shilling to the old lady in the pay box up the sawdust-covered
steps, and on the old lady shouting, &ldquo;Jimes,&rdquo; James
in uniform just inside the swing doors of the crowded, heated
music hall, said, &ldquo;Yessir.&nbsp; This way, sir.&nbsp; Stand
a <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>one
side, please, and let the genelman pass,&rdquo; and conducted
Bobbie ceremoniously past the folk who were standing at the back
of the first balcony; unlocked the door, showed him into the box;
fetched a programme, accepted twopence with a military salute,
called Bobbie &ldquo;Me lord,&rdquo; evidently mistaking him for
a member of the aristocracy.&nbsp; Then the boy settled down on
the front bench in the box, preparing to enjoy himself.&nbsp;
Fine to see the upturned faces from the twopenny pit&mdash;they
sat down in the pit now, he observed; in his day you had to
stand&mdash;the rows and rows of interested faces in the twopenny
gallery, and to note that many of them were watching him, the
only occupant of the shilling boxes.&nbsp; He felt confused at
first with this attention.&nbsp; Shielding himself behind the
dusty curtains, he gazed at Mlle. Printemps, who, with paper rose
in her hair, bare arms, bare shoulders, and scarlet tights, kept
her footing on a large white marble globe, juggling the while
with plates and knives and bottles.&nbsp; Once or twice Mlle.
Printemps, who was a little thin, perhaps, and red at the elbows,
but an agreeable person for all that, came over on the great
white globe quite close to the box in which Bobbie was seated,
whereupon he said softly (being a desperate sort of rattle out
for the evening), &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave your flower,
miss,&rdquo; and felt relieved to find that the thin lady on the
globe had not overheard him.&nbsp; Then came Bray and Wilkins,
described on the yellow slip as Irish-American duettists, the
finest humorists of two hemispheres, whose humour was not,
perhaps, so much fine as broad, being conducted somewhat in this
way: Bray, facing the audience, shouted, &ldquo;Oi say; have you
heard about me wife?&rdquo; and Wilkins, also facing the
audience, shouted back, &ldquo;Oi have not heard about your
wife;&rdquo; after a whispered communication, Wilkins assumed
incredulity, and said, &ldquo;Oi don&rsquo;t believe it,
sorr,&rdquo; and Bray, indignant, said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
truth I&rsquo;m giving ye; a fine bouncing boy at eighteen
minutes past five.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oi&rsquo;ll not believe
it,&rdquo; persisted Wilkins, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all your
kid,&rdquo; to which Bray replied indignantly, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
not my kid, sorr,&rdquo; and Wilkins retorted at once,
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s kid is it, then?&rdquo;&nbsp; Followed,
tremendous personal chastisement, which made Bobbie laugh until
tears came.&nbsp; After the American duettists, Mr. Tom Somebody
came shyly on the stage, affecting to be astonished at finding
himself there and rather wishful to go off again, but, on being
humorously appealed to by the conductor, deciding to stay.&nbsp;
Mr. Tom Somebody had been jilted by the lady of his heart, and it
seemed to the judicial observer that the lady might have found
excuse for her conduct in the singular manner of apparel the
gentleman wore, for he had no hat, but only the brim of a hat,
his jacket was very short, and his trousers very baggy; a paper
front stuck out ludicrously at his chest, and&mdash;this made
Bobbie shriek with delight&mdash;he had in the hurry of dressing
placed his collar around his waist.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;For
she&rsquo;s a daisy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sends me crazy,<br />
No wonder people say I&rsquo;m getting pline;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She only flouts me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And sometimes outs me,<br />
I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; simply barmy on account of
Emmer-jine.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At half-past eight the band played the National Anthem; the
attendants shouted the order for dispersal, and Bobbie, giving up
the private box with a sigh, followed the crowd down the stone
staircase.&nbsp; Outside, the patrons of the second performance
waited impatiently in a line at the edge of the <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>pavement.&nbsp; Bobbie recognized one or two faces in
the crowd; they looked older, he thought, and slightly dirtier;
those whom he remembered as boys of about his own age were
accompanied by young ladies, whose bare heads shone with oil, and
who wore, for the most part, maroon-coloured dresses, partly
shielded by aprons; they seemed in excellent spirits, and shouted
defiant badinage to friends at a distance.&nbsp; To Bobbie
walking down towards Old Street, it occurred that the true touch
of manliness would not he achieved until he secured the company
of a member of the opposite sex.&nbsp; He went into a
tobacconist&rsquo;s shop and bought a twopenny cigar, with a
paper belt, which he selected from a box labelled &ldquo;The
Rothschild Brand,&rdquo; and smoking this, he, with the cornet
placed in the capacious tail pocket of the frock-coat, strolled
through Shoreditch to Hackney Road.&nbsp; He winked at one or two
young women hurrying home with hot suppers laid on pieces of
paper, but they only sneered at him, one lady of about thirteen
declaring indignantly that, were her hands not full, she would
fetch him a clip side the ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this blooming coat,&rdquo; said Bobbie
ruefully.</p>
<p>These repulses brought disappointment, but happily there
existed other ways of proving to the world that he was now
thoroughly grown up.&nbsp; He went into a quiet public-house,
where, in the private bar, some bemused men were talking
politics, and on the invitation of the anxious young proprietor,
who appeared to be new to the business and desirous of obtaining
custom, Bobbie gave his opinion on the question of increasing the
strength of the Navy, and, encouraged by beer, found himself
quite eloquent.&nbsp; So eloquent, indeed, that presently he
insisted upon contradicting everybody, and some unpleasantness
ensued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll &rsquo;scuse me, my boy,&rdquo; said a
white-faced, sleepy-eyed baker, pointing unsteadily at Bobbie
with the stem of his pipe, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll &rsquo;scuse me if
I take the lib&rsquo;ty of tellin&rsquo; you&mdash;or rather I
sh&rsquo; say, informing you&mdash;that you&rsquo;re a
liar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You repeat that,&rdquo; said Bobbie, flushed and
aggressive.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go on!&nbsp; Say that again and see what
&rsquo;appens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was only meant as a pleasant joke, I expect,&rdquo;
urged the young proprietor nervously from the other side of the
counter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shake &rsquo;ands and make it
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him call me that again,&rdquo; said the boy
fiercely.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll learn
him, the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;d I call you?&rdquo; inquired the tipsy
baker.&nbsp; &ldquo;Best of my rec&rsquo;lection I called you
hon&rsquo;ble young genleman.&nbsp; Do you deny, sir, that
you&rsquo;re hon&rsquo;ble young genleman?&nbsp; Because, if
so,&rdquo; added the baker with great solemnity, &ldquo;if so, I
shall have great pleasure in&mdash;hic&mdash;drinkin&rsquo; your
&rsquo;ealth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been insulted!&rdquo; shouted the
scarlet-faced boy violently, &ldquo;in the presence of
gentlemen!&nbsp; I want this put right!&nbsp; I want an
apology!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m as good a man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; interrupted the anxious young
publican.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Ave a ceegar at my expense, and let
bygones be bygones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My young friend,&rdquo; said the baker, balancing to
and fro as he rested one hand on the zinc counter, &ldquo;if
I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;pologized to you in any way, I can only say
that it&rsquo;s purely cler&rsquo;cal error on my part, and
I&rsquo;m prepared to most humbly insult&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; corrected the young publican,
&ldquo;that if you&rsquo;ve insulted him you&rsquo;re prepared to
apologize.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>&ldquo;Dammit,&rdquo; cried the baker, turning
explosively on the young proprietor, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t two
genlemen settle their pers&rsquo;nal disputes without a blooming
pot&rsquo;ouse keeper dictatin&rsquo; to &rsquo;em?&nbsp;
What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bobbie, not to be outdone, &ldquo;what
th&rsquo; &rsquo;ell do you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mistook my meanin&rsquo;, gentlemen,&rdquo; said
the young publican penitently.&nbsp; &ldquo;All I want is peace
and quietness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precious rum way you&rsquo;ve got of going about
it,&rdquo; said Bobbie truculently.&nbsp; &ldquo;You take my
advice, Mr. Public-house, and don&rsquo;t you interfere with
whatever matters there may be in this world that don&rsquo;t in
no wise whatsoever tend to concern you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spoke,&rdquo; declared the tipsy baker, offering his
hand to Bobbie; &ldquo;spoke like a norator.&nbsp; Give us a
song, ole man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, I do hope&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t give you a song,&rdquo; said the flushed
boy; &ldquo;but I can give you a tune on the cornet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, gentlemen, do not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Music of the cornet,&rdquo; declared the bemused baker,
&ldquo;is like gen&rsquo;le dew of &rsquo;eaven.&nbsp; You blow
up, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the terror of the young publican, Bobbie produced his
cornet and played a verse of &ldquo;Tom Bowling,&rdquo; causing
the baker to become maudlin, and to declare tearfully that he
wished he had been a sailor instead of an adjective baker,
trampled on by most and scorned by all.&nbsp; On Bobbie playing
the prelude to the first set of some quadrilles, the private bar,
standing up tipsily, set to partners and went through the
evolutions with intense gravity, excepting the baker, who, acting
as M.C., stumbled in and out crying loudly,
&ldquo;La&rsquo;ies&rsquo; chain!&rdquo;&nbsp; The agitated young
publican, fearful of consequences, felt constrained at last to
send for a policeman, and when one came and touched the boy
cornet player on the shoulder, saying, &ldquo;Outside with that
instrument of torture, if you please,&rdquo; then Bobbie stepped
out of the swing doors and through a small crowd with the proud
consciousness that, having been ejected from a public-house, real
manhood was now his, and could never be taken from him.&nbsp; He
stumbled along Hackney Road with his cornet, a slip of a crowd
following.&nbsp; To escape them he jumped clumsily on a tram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;O&rsquo; tight,&rdquo; said the conductor.</p>
<p>The boy rode in a confused state of mind to the end of the
journey at Lea Bridge Road, and then, partly sobered by the night
air, returned by the tram.&nbsp; He felt quite happy; other
passengers found themselves afire with curiosity to know what he
was laughing about.&nbsp; Watching the lighted shops and the
cheerful folk on the pavement below, Bobbie decided hilariously
that this was better than the Cottage Homes.&nbsp; This was
good.&nbsp; This was enjoyment.&nbsp; This was
independence.&nbsp; This was freedom.&nbsp; This was life.</p>
<p>At Cambridge Heath Station he descended, because be saw
outside a large public-house a line of brakes decorated with
branches of trees and with Chinese lanterns; joyous men and women
danced on the square space to no music.&nbsp; This seemed the
kind of movement in which he desired to be.&nbsp; The men and
women had been out into the country for the day; they appeared to
have brought a good deal of the country back with them, for their
hats and bonnets and clothes were decorated with bunches of
flowers and oak leaves.&nbsp; The appearance of the boy with his
cornet was welcomed with enthusiasm.&nbsp; Hoisted up on a huge
empty cask, he, by <a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>command, played gustily a waltz that made the couples
lay heads on their partners&rsquo; shoulders and move slowly,
dreamily around.&nbsp; Of all the moments of pure delight that
Bobbie, as a boy, was to experience, this ever stood in his
memory high and high above all the rest.&nbsp; Presently the
whirling crowd stopped exhaustedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask the little boy,&rdquo; suggested one of the panting
women, &ldquo;to play a what&rsquo;s-a-name tune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A comic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no!&nbsp; Not a comic.&nbsp; You know what I
mean, only you&rsquo;re so stupid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A love tune?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re like all
the men; you&rsquo;ve got no sense.&nbsp; What I mean is a
patriotic song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therefore, &ldquo;Rule Britannia&rdquo; from the cornet to the
great content of the beanfeasters and of the two or three
constables, looking on at the scene good-naturedly.&nbsp; A hat
went round before the party re-ascended the brakes, and Bobbie
found himself in possession of a load of coppers that weighed him
down on one side until he bethought himself of the ingenious plan
of dividing them and placing one half in each pocket of his
trousers.&nbsp; He saw the brakes depart, and was about to leave
when he found his arm seized violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got him,&rdquo; shrieked Master Niedermann
fiercely.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought I should find him.&nbsp; Evil
doers never succeed for long.&nbsp; I was sure&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leggo my arm,&rdquo; said Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Likely thing,&rdquo; screamed the long youth
satirically, &ldquo;after I&rsquo;ve took all this trouble to
find you.&nbsp; Gimme back my frock coat!&nbsp; Gimme back my
frock-coat, that you pinched from me!&nbsp; Gimme
back&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the constables stepped forward.&nbsp; What was all this
about?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sergeant,&rdquo; cried Master Niedermann flatteringly,
&ldquo;thank goodness you&rsquo;re &rsquo;ere.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll
see that right&rsquo;s done.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s robbed me of my
best frock-coat, and I want it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; declared Bobbie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Fact of the matter is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accuses me now,&rdquo; said the estimable youth, with a
pained air, &ldquo;of telling a falsehood.&nbsp; Why, I
couldn&rsquo;t tell a falsehood, and well you know it,
inspector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constable begged to say that he knew nothing of the
kind.&nbsp; Let the boy tell his tale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We changed coats, sir,&rdquo; said Bobbie,
&ldquo;against my wish, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s alf a dollar sewed in the corner of
it,&rdquo; interrupted Nose, &ldquo;and he must &rsquo;ave known
it, or else he&rsquo;d never &rsquo;ave thrown me down on the
ground and clutched my neck with both his hands&mdash;like
so&mdash;and then pulled the coat bodily off of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constable, his legal mind detecting an error in the statement,
asked, in view of the fact that the boy had but two hands, how
this was done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ast him!&rdquo; said Master Niedermann.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
knows!&nbsp; He did it.&nbsp; And make him gimme back my coat and
my &rsquo;alf dollar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constable requested to be informed how the half dollar had
been earned or obtained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be the sweat of me brow,&rdquo; declared the long
youth.&nbsp; &ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye think?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d forgot
where I put it for the moment, or else he should never have had
it.&nbsp; And if he don&rsquo;t give it me, I give him in
charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ang me if I give it back,&rdquo; said Bobbie,
with sudden asperity.&nbsp; &ldquo;You <a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>said a bargain&rsquo;s a bargain, and
so it&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave to be.&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t change
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Master Niedermann, oracularly,
&ldquo;I &rsquo;ereby beg to give him into custody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The constable seemed undecided.&nbsp; Bobbie watched his face,
and trembled as he observed a slight increase in gravity.&nbsp;
The police station meant at least an ignominious return to the
Homes, and to the precise and dogmatically ordered life
there.&nbsp; A crowd had gathered round close to the disputant
parties, and Bobbie, withdrawing his anxious glance from the
policeman for a moment to look around, saw a very little woman,
whose face he remembered.&nbsp; Miss Threepenny.&nbsp; Her queer
head came to about the waists of the people standing near to
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;d better,&rdquo; said the
constable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-five, Barton Buildings,&rdquo; whispered little
Miss Threepenny.&nbsp; Then, with a quick change of voice and
manner, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s got my purse?&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s stole
my purse?&nbsp; Police!&nbsp; Stop thief!&nbsp;
&rsquo;Elp&mdash;&rsquo;elp&mdash;&rsquo;elp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The constable hurried quickly from the doubtful case on which
he was engaged to this that appeared more definite.&nbsp; In the
commotion, Bobbie, holding his cornet tightly, made swift escape;
he had reached Bethnal Green Road before Miss
Threepenny&mdash;having discovered that her purse had, after all,
not been stolen&mdash;had apologized to the constable for the
unnecessary trouble that she had given.&nbsp; Bobbie was still
recovering breath at the entrance to the giant block of model
dwellings to which Miss Threepenny had hurriedly directed him,
when that excellent little woman trotted up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a nice young man,&rdquo; said Miss
Threepenny severely, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think.&nbsp; Going and
getting yourself mixed up in a common street row, and forgetting
what you owe to your poor dead mother and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobbie explained truthfully, and little Miss Threepenny
relented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do now?&rdquo; she asked, looking
up at him with less acerbity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get a bed in a coffee shop, I s&rsquo;pose,&rdquo; said
the boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;To-morrow I shall get off to the country to
see&mdash;to see some friends.&nbsp; This bloomin&rsquo; London
makes my nut ache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The small woman stood on the third step of the stone stairs,
so that she came thus face to face with Bobbie.&nbsp; She swung
her key round her finger, reflectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll only get into more trouble,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Likely as not,&rdquo; replied the boy recklessly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do right, somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nearly &rsquo;alf a mind,&rdquo; said the
little woman, &ldquo;to make you up a bed in my
sitting-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got two rooms now, Miss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather,&rdquo; said the little woman proudly.</p>
<p>He followed Miss Threepenny upstairs, through passages, and up
more stairs to her rooms.&nbsp; There the diminutive woman took
off her bonnet and set to work, as she said, to put the place to
rights, which, seeing that everything was perfectly neat and in
order, seemed a superfluous act, and indeed consisted mainly in
moving the furniture from it&rsquo;s proper place and setting it
back again.&nbsp; Bobbie felt confused and very tired, but the
little woman appeared so obviously glad to have someone to talk
to that he listened politely to her good-tempered chatters.&nbsp;
They had supper together, <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>and then Miss Threepenny did
something to an elderly easy chair in the manner of an expert
conjuror, whereupon it instantly changed into a middle-aged
couch.&nbsp; She bustled in and out of her own room, bringing a
pillow and some sheets; presently Bobbie found that he could no
longer look at the couch without yawning desperately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the morning,&rdquo; said the tiny woman, lighting a
candle, &ldquo;you sleep on, because I shall be out and about
early.&nbsp; And I shall be &rsquo;ome midday to give you your
dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goo&rsquo; night,&rdquo; said the boy sleepily, taking
his coat off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear!&rdquo; cried the little woman with a comic
affectation of bashfulness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do wait till I&rsquo;m
out of the room.&nbsp; You forget that I&rsquo;m an old
maid.&nbsp; Some of you young men nowadays are enough to shock a
saint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wish you&rsquo;d got a son of your own,
miss?&rdquo; asked Bobbie, &ldquo;to live here and look after
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuff and nonsense!&rdquo; she answered quickly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What should I want with a great big slab of a boy knocking
about the place?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a ridiculous idea to be
sure!&nbsp; Wonder what put that into your head, for
goodness&rsquo; sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing special,&rdquo; said the boy, yawning.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Goo&rsquo; ni&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; said the little woman
hesitatingly, &ldquo;if you like, Bobbie, you can do this.&nbsp;
Jest for fun, you know.&nbsp; You can give me a kiss on the
forehead and say, &lsquo;Good night, mother.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;
She laughed awkwardly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only for the lark of the
thing, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, mother,&rdquo; said the boy obediently,
bending down and kissing her above the eyes.&nbsp; The little
woman gasped and ran quickly to her room.</p>
<p>In the morning Bobbie awoke, when at six o&rsquo;clock Miss
Threepenny was at work still setting the place to rights, and
arranging, as he quietly noticed, his breakfast.&nbsp; As she
came over to him, before going off, and looked down at him, he
kept his eyes half-closed.&nbsp; When presently he had risen, and
had eaten his breakfast, he made out an account on the back of an
envelope thus, and laid the money upon it:&mdash;</p>

quietly.</p>

62</span>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> boy discovered in London that
day how much possession of a little money helps enjoyment.&nbsp;
One does not want very much in London, but one does want some,
and Bobbie, with four or five shillings in his pocket, found
delights that London millionaires can never encounter.&nbsp; Two
shillings and threepence of his fortune went to the purchase in
City Road of a hard felt hat.&nbsp; The proprietor of the shop
urged him to purchase a silk hat, and the boy tried one on,
laughing very much at his own reflection in the mirror, but there
were several good reasons why he should not agree with the
proprietor (&ldquo;A silk hat,&rdquo; argued the proprietor,
&ldquo;tells me that a man&rsquo;s a gentleman&rdquo;), of which
one was that he remembered reading a reply to a correspondent in
one of the newspapers at Collingwood Cottage, which stated that a
silk hat was not &ldquo;de rigueur&rdquo; for the country or the
seaside; a second that he did not possess more than half the
amount required for the cheapest specimen.&nbsp; The bowler hat,
however, brought great content.&nbsp; Later in the day, finding
himself in Hyde Park, he fastened his long frock-coat as well as
the existing buttons would permit, and strolled down the Row,
lifting his hat now and again to no one with great
courtesy.&nbsp; He became exceedingly wishful to find some person
with whom he might talk.&nbsp; He was getting on rather well with
a little six-year-old maid, and had made for her fair-haired doll
a couch of grass near the Achilles statue, and the little girl
had told him that she had such a booful mamma and such a horrid
large nurse and such a fearfully hard piano and such oceans of
toys, when she and her doll were whisked away magically by the
large nurse referred to, and Bobbie spent two whole hours in
searching for them with no success.&nbsp; Out in Knightsbridge a
string of sandwich men walked along gloomily, bearing
advertisements of a new piece at one of the West End theatres; it
occurred to the boy that it would be rather a fine, lordly act to
pay his shilling and go to a first-class play, just for all the
world as though he lived in Belgravia.&nbsp; The idea clipped his
fancy, and despite the fact that after dinner at a cheap
restaurant, whose proud boast was, &ldquo;Come in here, and you
will never go anywhere else,&rdquo; he found that he would only
have just enough left to pay his fare to the nearest railway
station to Brenchley, he made up his mind to go to the
theatre.&nbsp; He had a good wash at the cheap restaurant, and
parted his hair in the middle, looking very closely to see if
there existed a suspicion of down upon his upper lip.&nbsp; It
was magnificent, this life of independence, but, obviously, there
were drawbacks.&nbsp; For instance, you had not only to arrange
for your meals, but you had also to pay them; this done, the fact
remained that neither the quantity nor the quality proved so good
as in the Cottage Homes.&nbsp; The boy foresaw (without troubling
himself very much about it) that herein might be found a source
of inconvenience.&nbsp; He packed the cornet very carefully in a
borrowed newspaper; the cornet was slightly in the way, but he
remembered that it belonged to the Cottage Homes, and he meant to
return it there eventually.&nbsp; It was wrong to steal.</p>
<p>At the gallery door of the theatre that evening he found
himself in a short queue, side by side with a thoughtful-looking
youth, who carried on his arm an aged travelling rug.&nbsp; This
youth talked very learnedly to Bobbie about the new phases of the
drama, Bobbie listening with <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>respect because it was a subject on
which he felt himself to be not completely informed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Convention,&rdquo; said the thoughtful young man,
covering both of his arms with the old travelling rug and edging
nearer to the two ladies in front, &ldquo;convention, my dear
sir, is the curse of the modern drama.&nbsp; The drama is
enwrapped with iron shackles, and it screams aloud&mdash;excuse
me, madam, they&rsquo;re pushing at the back&mdash;and it screams
aloud, &lsquo;Release my bonds and give me
liberty.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we want is to see the realities of life placed
upon the stage,&rdquo; went on the thoughtful youth, &ldquo;not a
transparent imitation.&nbsp; We require the stage to give up its
great services to the threshing out of some of the world&rsquo;s
trying problems, and to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best piece I ever see was at the Britannia,
&rsquo;Oxton,&rdquo; interrupted Bobbie, &ldquo;when I was a
kid.&nbsp; There was a man in it and a woman, and you must
understand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got change for half a sovereign?&rdquo; interrupted the
thoughtful youth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Small silver will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is all I &rsquo;ave,&rdquo; said Bobbie, showing
the coins which were left to him, &ldquo;besides the bob
I&rsquo;ve got in me hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the youth regretfully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no use to me.&nbsp; Put it back in your
breast pocket&mdash;so.&nbsp; Allow me.&nbsp; If you place your
handkerchief over it in this way, you&rsquo;ll find yourself
quite safe from thieves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose there are some about still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Town&rsquo;s full of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said the other
regretfully.</p>
<p>The narrow crowd made a movement, and the pairs closed
up.&nbsp; A facetious man in the very front rapped twice at the
doors, affecting to be the post.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to-night?&rdquo; asked the youth
suddenly.&nbsp; Bobbie gave the information.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed the youth, with great
concern.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here am I wasting my time hanging about
when I&rsquo;ve got an engagement with a lady of title at a
reunion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say you forgot all about it,&rdquo; suggested
Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would,&rdquo; said the troubled youth confidentially,
&ldquo;only Lady B.&rsquo;s such a jealous woman.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s as much as she&rsquo;ll do to let me out of her
sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Bobbie, chaffingly, &ldquo;if you
will get mixed up with the fair sex, you must put up with the
consequences.&rdquo;&nbsp; The youth went off as the doors
opened, and the short, eel-like crowd slipping in demurely, went
up the stairs.</p>
<p>When they were all seated it appeared that there was plenty of
room for everybody; indeed only the two front rows secured any
patrons, and the programme girl at the back, looking down at the
scantily filled benches, said something so bitter and satirical
to the policeman on duty, that one of her hairpins fell out, and
tripped down the steps of the silent gallery, quite startling the
few demure people.&nbsp; The patrons spoke in whispers; when
Bobbie commenced to whistle, with a view of cheering them, they
said &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; and frowned at him.</p>
<p>A few people strayed into the dress circle and into the stalls
below; the gentlemen declining to buy programmes, and the ladies
pinning their tweed caps to their petticoats.&nbsp; Bobbie called
out very loudly, &ldquo;Orders!&rdquo; and the constable up at
the back interrupted his conversation with the satirical
programme girl to whisper a reproof.&nbsp; An important-looking
gentleman in <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>white waistcoat came into a box, and surveyed through
his opera glasses the gallery with contemptuous air; Bobbie,
chafing under this deliberate inspection, and disregarding the
indignant looks of his neighbours, said distinctly and
repeatedly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take off that&mdash;white&mdash;weskit.&nbsp; Take
off&mdash;that&mdash;white&mdash;weskit.&nbsp; Take
off&mdash;that&mdash;white&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Until the important gentleman had to retire defeated behind
the hangings of the box.&nbsp; Presently a small orchestra
stumbled shyly in, with a conductor, who, having looked round and
yawned openly at the house, led them through a sleepy waltz, that
eventually induced Bobbie to kick loudly at the wooden front of
the gallery.&nbsp; The curtain went up to a few bars of a comic
song, and then Bobbie, hopeful of enjoyment, took off his
frock-coat, and leaned forward expectantly.</p>
<p>The bills described the play as a highly diverting original
comedy fantasy, which was so long a title that it might well have
included some of the elements of truth; but, as it proved, did
not.&nbsp; A smart young maid and a mild footman were discovered
on the stage, and these dusting at nothing in the elaborate
breakfast-room with great energy, explained to each other that
master had not been home the previous night, that mistress had
gone to meet her aunt at Southampton, that this was a rum
household, upon their word, and that they would be glad when they
should have made enough money to take that little public-house on
which they had set their hearts.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the maid
boxed the ears of the mild footman soundly when he attempted to
kiss her, at which moment one of the many doors in the room
opened, and a wild-eyed young man appeared in evening dress, his
necktie awry, and a hunted, affrighted look on his face.&nbsp;
The two servants having taken his hoarsely-whispered commands for
breakfast and disappeared, the distraught-looking master,
advancing to the footlights, told the nearly empty house the
story of his trouble.&nbsp; Taking advantage, it seemed, of his
wife&rsquo;s absence, he had been to a fancy dress ball the night
before.&nbsp; There he had met an exceedingly handsome, opulent
lady of South American extraction, who comported herself with
great hauteur and coldness until a sudden alarm of
&ldquo;Fire&rdquo; took place; on the instant he had clung to her
from sheer nervousness and she had dragged him safely from the
place.&nbsp; Arrived outside, the lady, to his amazement,
declared him to be her preserver, disclosed her Christian name as
Evangeline; swore never to leave him, but to confer upon him her
hand in marriage, and when he attempted to fly, ran after
him.&nbsp; The smart maid here interrupted, announcing, &ldquo;A
lady to see you, sir, and please mistress has
arrived.&rdquo;&nbsp; Entrance of a veiled lady, who, as the
young master took refuge under a table, went across and through a
doorway; entrance at that instant of young wife; ingenious but
inexact explanation of his appearance by the husband; sudden
return of the strange lady, who, giving up the veil, cried,
&ldquo;My preserver!&rdquo; the young husband cried, &ldquo;My
Evangeline!&rdquo; the young wife cried, &ldquo;My aunt!&rdquo;
and&mdash;curtain on the first act.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bobbie, looking around, &ldquo;of all
the dam silly plays&mdash;Ello!&nbsp; Ello!&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s
pinched my oof?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What say, little boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s took my money,&rdquo; demanded the boy, his
face white.&nbsp; He looked under the seat, but it had not fallen
out of the pocket.&nbsp; &ldquo;Three or four bob I had and every
penny&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned savagely to the lady next him, &ldquo;Have you got
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>So far
from having Bobbie&rsquo;s money, it appeared that the lady
herself had lost a purse which she had carried, for the better
convenience of the thoughtful young man outside with the
travelling rug, in a back pocket which everybody could get at but
herself.&nbsp; Bobbie, sick and depressed at his loss, sat
through the rest of the play trying to think out a plan of
action, arriving just before eleven at a decision.&nbsp; The
husband of the lady who had been robbed of her purse became so
elated and triumphant over the event (having, it seemed, always
prophesied that this would happen, and being one not often
successful in forecasts) that he gave Bobbie sixpence, and
Bobbie, after groaning in an unearthly way at the close of the
piece, went out and down the stairs into the bright, crowded,
busy street, with this coin for only monetary possession.</p>
<p>Charing Cross Station was filled with theatre patrons who,
judging from their pleased faces, had been more fortunate than
Bobbie, and were now hastening to suburban homes.&nbsp; Ladies in
gossamer cloaks flew about excitedly in search of their platform;
men in evening dress imperilled the catching of their last train
by making frantic rushes to the refreshment bar.&nbsp; Bobbie
discovered that the last train to Paddock Wood had gone;
discovered also the platform from which the Tonbridge train
(Tonbridge being the next convenient station) started, and,
taking advantage of a sudden rush at the barrier, slipped in
between the people and was borne by them along the
platform.&nbsp; There he found the train waiting; found the
guard&rsquo;s van of the train; found a corner in the van, and
whilst the young guard collected the offertory from third-class
passengers for whom he had found room in another class of
carriage, Bobbie secreted himself behind a big square wicker
basket.&nbsp; The young guard whistled; the engine whistled, the
doors banged to, the young guard jumped neatly into his brake,
shouting good-night to the officials on the platform; the train
went out across the bridge, and presently, after one or two
stops, away into the dark country.&nbsp; The boy, crouching
uncomfortably in ambuscade, consoled himself with
anticipation.&nbsp; Once in the Duchess&rsquo;s hotel comfort and
he would not again separate.&nbsp; Perhaps they would put him in
a uniform and make him General Commanding of the Hall; he could
see the hall lined with giant palms; polite waiters at the far
end guarding entrance to an elaborately-furnished
dining-room.&nbsp; There would be mirrors with (he felt sure of
this) roses painted upon them.&nbsp; He could imagine all this;
what he could not adequately picture was the elaborate hot
breakfast which the Duchess would cause to be prepared for
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said the young guard, entering the van
from his compartment, &ldquo;now for a struggle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobbie, hiding low behind the square basket, trembled.&nbsp;
He had some thought of giving himself up and throwing himself
upon the mercy of the guard, but he decided to wait.&nbsp; He
could hear the rustling of pages as the young guard standing
under the roof lamp commenced in a loud voice to
recite:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A signalman sat in his signal-box<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A thinking of this and that,<br />
When the eight-ten mail went rushing by,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he started, for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The young guard made his way steadily through the verses, then
closing the book, tried to recite them without assistance, and
partly succeeded, partly failed.</p>
<p><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>&ldquo;I shall be no more better perfect by
Thursday,&rdquo; said the young guard hopelessly, &ldquo;than my
old lamp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Tonbridge, when the train stopped&mdash;the hour being now
near upon one&mdash;Bobbie, who had been dozing under the effects
of the guard&rsquo;s recital, warily bestirred himself.&nbsp; He
waited until the guard had stepped out, and then, by rushing into
the centre compartment of the van, he just managed to elude the
porters who had thrown open the doors to clear out parcels.&nbsp;
Bobbie jumped down from the off side of the brake on to the
ballast, and intuitively made his way down the line.&nbsp; He had
to reach the next station, Paddock Wood, and then the course
would be clear; in all he guessed there was about a ten miles
walk before him, and, by refraining from hurry, this ought to
take him through the night.&nbsp; He walked carefully away from
the station into the black night by the side of the lines, but
not so carefully as to avoid an occasional stumble over iron rods
connecting the points.&nbsp; By good chance he chose the line
which would take him to Paddock Wood, and he made his way
stolidly in the darkness along the straight rails, the cornet in
his tail pocket knocking at his ankles.&nbsp; Looking back he saw
the red and green lights of the junction that he had left;
looking forward he saw nothing.&nbsp; Now and again he struck a
match for the sake of company, and then for a moment he caught
sight of the four shining rails and the tall gaunt telegraph
posts; resting at one or two of these posts, he had a talk with
them, and listened to their ceaseless humming.&nbsp; He was not
afraid yet, because a spirit of adventure was in the air; he knew
several boys at the Homes who would have shrieked with terror to
find themselves alone like this on a black night in a lonely
country with which they were not acquainted.&nbsp; The dead
silence was just beginning to terrify him when far ahead he saw
two small white eyes.&nbsp; They came nearer and nearer and
larger and larger.&nbsp; The boy became nervous.&nbsp; He stopped
and stumbled down into the dry ditch that ran along by the side
of the railway; the two white eyes came upon him with a hissing
sound, Bobbie put his hands over his face and held his
breath.&nbsp; A fierce tumultuous rush past; a flash of
light.&nbsp; Bobbie venturing to remove his hands after a full
minute, saw that the engine, out alone at a time of night when
all respectable engines should have been abed, was a distance
off, its rear light showing redly.</p>
<p>He felt shaken by this, but he made his way doggedly along the
loose ballasted walk, through the dark, still night, trying not
to think of what he was doing; nevertheless, he still counted the
gaunt telegraph posts, and told each of them its number.&nbsp; He
had been walking, he thought, about an hour and a half, when he
saw specks of coloured lights in the distance, and he knew that
he was nearing a station.&nbsp; From thence he would have to
branch off to the right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting on a fair treat,&rdquo; he said,
cheerfully.</p>
<p>At Paddock Wood, noise and commotion that were grateful after
the silence of the walk.&nbsp; Goods trains blundering about in
sidings and excited men with lamps begging them to be reasonable,
but the trucks of goods trains declining to listen to advice, and
quarrelling and nudging and punching and shoving each other in a
great state of ill-temper.&nbsp; Engines, on the earnest appeal
of the men with lamps, hurried to restore order, and the occasion
being one demanding drastic remedy, half a dozen specially
quarrelsome trucks were selected for punishment, a masterful
engine drew them out on a middle line, and when one of the men
with lamps had uncoupled <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>them, the engine made a sudden rush
and sent them all flying away into a distant siding where they
could no longer interfere with the general order.&nbsp; Something
of quiet ensuing upon this, the engine-drivers drank hot tea out
of tin cans, and the shunters with lamps made a hasty meal of
thick bread and thick bacon&mdash;a meal interrupted by the
arrival of a long, overgrown goods train, which insisted upon
ridding itself of a dozen trucks, and went after a while with an
exultant shriek at having got the best of somebody.&nbsp; Bobbie
stood away from all this, watching it with great delight.&nbsp;
He had begun to feel sleepy.&nbsp; This awakened him.</p>
<p>He went out through the flat, silent, straggling village, and
found, by climbing a finger-post and striking a match, the
direction that he had to take for Brenchley.&nbsp; There was a
vague touch of lightness now in the starless sky; passing by the
quick-set hedge, bordering a churchyard, he could see upright
tombstones, dimly white, and the sight depressed the boy, for he
knew that here were those whose memory to some was dear.&nbsp;
The boy came to cross roads, and then found that his box of
matches had disappeared through a hole in his frock-coat
pocket.&nbsp; He sat down with his back against the post fixed in
the grass triangle at the centre of the roads; before he had time
to warn himself to keep awake, his eyes closed.&nbsp; He
slept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then!&rdquo; said a voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Time all
boys was out of bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, mother,&rdquo; said the boy
sleepily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was just getting&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rubbed his eyes and looked around.&nbsp; Instead of the
neat room with its red-counterpaned beds, and the mother of
Collingwood Cottage shaking his shoulder&mdash;broad daylight and
the open country.&nbsp; The person who had awakened him was a
uniformed man, with a straight-peaked cap which bore the figure
of a horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know where you are?&rdquo; asked the uniformed man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just beginning to guess,&rdquo; said the boy
blinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you bound for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it got to do with you?&rdquo; asked
Bobbie, yawning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got all to do with me, as it happens.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m the constable in charge of this district.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, yes!&rdquo; said the boy incredulously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your &rsquo;elmet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; remarked the constable, with
tolerance.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re town bred, I can see.&nbsp;
What you got in your tail pocket?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cornet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine,&rdquo; said the boy defiantly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s did you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One minute,&rdquo; said the constable sharply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t done with you yet, my lad.&nbsp; If
that&rsquo;s your cornet, and you&rsquo;ve come by it honest, you
can no doubt play a tune on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I play a tune to an amateur,
&rsquo;alf-baked copper like you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you,&rdquo; said the constable
gleefully.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you, my lad, on a piece of
string.&nbsp; Wandering about with no vis&rsquo;ble means of
subsistence; also in possession of property that he is unable to
account for.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll borrow a dog-cart, and take you off
to Tonbridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it a name, then,&rdquo; said the boy sulkily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dreamt I dwelt in marble
&rsquo;alls,&rsquo;&rdquo; suggested the constable.</p>
<p>Bobbie played this, and the constable, much delighted, not
only gave up all idea of the dog-cart and Tonbridge, but asked
for another verse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time do you make it?&rdquo; asked Bobbie, wiping
his lips.</p>
<p><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>He felt
hungry; the thought of hot coffee and hot rolls, and broiled ham
and eggs, waiting for him at the Duchess&rsquo;s magnificent
hotel, made him anxious.&nbsp; The constable lifted a huge watch
from his trousers pocket.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wants a quarter to
six,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Appen to know a place up at Brenchley called
&lsquo;The Happy Retreat&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather fine hotel, isn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; One of the
most important places of its kind in the district, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of its kind,&rdquo; said the constable,
&ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do an extr&rsquo;ordinary business there, don&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most extr&rsquo;ordinary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which road do I take to get to it
quickest?&rdquo;&nbsp; The constable pointed with his
stick.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know the landlord and the landlady, and I
want to get there for breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could see you was well connected,&rdquo; remarked the
constable pleasantly, &ldquo;by the fit of your coat.&nbsp; Give
my regards to &rsquo;em, and tell &rsquo;em from me that ten
o&rsquo;clock&rsquo;s their time for closing, not
&rsquo;alf-past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; said Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us another verse of &lsquo;Dreamt I
dwelt,&rsquo;&rdquo; begged the constable, &ldquo;&rsquo;fore you
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The country was already rousing itself, being a country that
went to bed early, and able, therefore, to rise betimes.&nbsp;
Smoke puffed straight out of the chimneys stuck atop of the
infrequent cottages; a grateful scent of boiling tea came from
the open doors across the gardens of flowers to the
roadway.&nbsp; Conceited poultry strutted out to the gate and
crowed; birds up in the trees whistled and chirruped ceaselessly;
rooks flew about near a row of tall poplars trying their voices,
voices which seemed rather hoarse and out of practice.&nbsp; At
one place by the side of the roadway where the green border was
spacious, gipsies in their yellow-painted van were bestirring
themselves, and scantily-clothed, brown-skinned children affected
to wash at the brook whilst their parents quarrelled
loudly.&nbsp; The male parent broke off to call to Bobbie, asking
him if he wanted a lift to London.&nbsp; Bobbie shook his head,
and hurried on up the hill.&nbsp; A postman went by on his
tricycle, reading the postcards entrusted to him as he went; at
the diamond-patterned windows on the top floor of cottages,
apple-cheeked, white-shouldered girls were doing their hair,
holding a rope of it between their teeth and plaiting the
rest.&nbsp; A tramp who had been sleeping in a barn slouched
along, picking straws from his deplorable clothes and swearing
softly to himself.&nbsp; Men in thick, earth-covered boots came
out of their houses to go to their work in the fields, and small
babies waved hands to them from the protected doorways.&nbsp;
Bobbie noticed, away from the road, a small, dilapidated house
with a vague, unintelligible sign-post, and anxious to arrive at
the Duchess&rsquo;s hotel without error, he went to
inquire.&nbsp; He pushed open the door; stepped in on the floor
of uneven bricks.&nbsp; A lazy smell of stale beer pervaded the
low-ceilinged passage; to the right was a room with a dirty
table, dirtier by reason of sticky rings made by pots of
beer.&nbsp; At the end of the table, smooth spaces caused by
practice of the game of shove-halfpenny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shop!&rdquo; called Bobbie.</p>
<p>No answer!&nbsp; He went through the passage.&nbsp; It was a
beer-house evidently; a few casks stood about and unwashed
earthenware mugs lined <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>the counter.&nbsp; Dirt and
untidiness everywhere.&nbsp; Upstairs he heard a voice crooning,
and he listened anxiously, for the song seemed familiar.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You should see us in our landor when
we&rsquo;re drivin&rsquo; in the Row,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You should &rsquo;ear us chaff the dukes and belted
earls.<br />
We&rsquo;re daughters of nobility&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Duchess!&rdquo; cried the boy.</p>
<p>The song stopped.&nbsp; A window of the room above opened and
the Duchess&rsquo;s voice could be heard upbraiding Mr.
Leigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fat lot of good you do pottering about in the garden
and pretendin&rsquo; you was born and bred in the country.&nbsp;
Wish to goodness we was back in Ely Place again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Leigh begged that the Duchess would hold her row and let
him get on with his scarlet runners in peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace?&rdquo; cried the Duchess, scornfully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a jolly sight too much peace about this dead
and alive &rsquo;ole.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a woman used to a certain
amount of seeciety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Leigh advised her to go downstairs and have a drop of beer
and then get back to bed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beer and bed,&rdquo; complained the Duchess with great
contempt.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s about all there is in this
place.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d rather be Bat Miller and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For goodness sake,&rdquo; begged Mr. Leigh,
&ldquo;&rsquo;ush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t &rsquo;ush,&rdquo; declared the Duchess,
preparing to slam the window.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall tell everybody
why we&rsquo;re come &rsquo;ere and what you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Leigh, speaking for once with decision, said imperatively,
&ldquo;Shut that winder and shut your mouth, or else I&rsquo;ll
come and do both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Duchess obeyed, and Bobbie stood back as he heard her
coming in slippered feet down the stairs.&nbsp; Few of us look
our best at six o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and the Duchess
formed no exception.&nbsp; It was not easy to glance at her
without a shudder.</p>
<p>The boy turned and hurried out.&nbsp; He ran swiftly, crying
as he went, down the hill to the gipsies&rsquo; van.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Myddleton West</span> still lived in the
rooms over a fancy wool shop in Fetter Lane, which he had rented
when he first came to London.&nbsp; At times he had thought of
going into one of the Inns close by, and had inspected chambers
there, but he found so many ghosts on every landing that,
although a man of fair courage, he became affrighted.&nbsp; Over
the fancy wool shop in Fetter Lane, no shadows interfered.&nbsp;
The Misses Langley kept his rooms carefully dusted, seeing that
the panel photograph of an attractive young nurse, with a
thoughtful face, never moved from its position of honour on the
mantelpiece.&nbsp; Myddleton West was getting on in the world and
earning agreeable cheques every month; like many young men in
this position, he found it difficult to increase his expenses
without taking inordinate pains.&nbsp; Consequently he gave up
attempts in <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>this direction, and remained in Fetter Lane, writing
early and late on any subject that the world offered, finding
this the only way to keep his mind from the thoughtful young
woman of the panel portrait.&nbsp; Rarely she took brief holiday
from the ward of which she was sister, and they met by
appointment at an aerated bread shop, where, over chocolate, she
knitted her pretty forehead and talked with the concentrated
wisdom of at least three hundred young women, on Myddleton West
becoming urgent in his protestations of love, reproving him with
a quaint air of austerity that at once annoyed and delighted
him.&nbsp; He found no argument in favour of their marriage that
she did not instantly defeat by a proud reference to the work
which Fate had assigned to her.&nbsp; This was their only
contentious subject; once free of it they were on excellent
terms, and West took her on from the tea-rooms to private views
and to afternoon performances at the theatre, and to concerts,
and was an enchanted man until the moment came for her to fly
back in her grey silk cloak to the hospital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said Myddleton West.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me interrupting, sir, in your writing
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t matter, Miss Langley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I often say to my sister,&rdquo; persisted the thin
lady at the doorway, &ldquo;no one can possibly write sense if
they&rsquo;re to be continually broken in on&mdash;if I may use
the expression&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody called to see me?&rdquo; asked West,
patiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And badgered out of their life,&rdquo; concluded the
lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure writing must be quite
sufficient a tax on the brains without&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Langley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I understand that some one has called to see
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. West,&rdquo; confessed Miss Langley, with a burst
of frankness, &ldquo;some one has called to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Myddleton West, definitely,
&ldquo;show them up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a them, sir, it&rsquo;s only a bit of a
lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, show him up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>West finished the sentence which he had commenced, and then,
hearing a slipping footstep, swung round in his chair
again.&nbsp; A boy in a long worn frock-coat, his bowler hat
dented, stood at the doorway, white of face, his under lip not
quite under control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&rsquo; cheer?&rdquo; said the boy with an effort to
appear at ease.&nbsp; &ldquo;How goes it with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit,&rdquo; said Myddleton West, rising and
standing in front of the fireplace.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me see now
if I can remember you.&nbsp; Take off your hat.&rdquo;&nbsp; West
dropped his pince-nez and peered across the room at the
boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have three shots,&rdquo; he said
presently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your name is Cumberland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met you&mdash;let me see&mdash;at an inquest in
Hoxton some years ago; I saw you later at the police
station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting warmer.&nbsp; Now try the letter
L.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your name is Lincoln.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bit more to the left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lancaster!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bull&rsquo;s-eye!&rdquo; said the white-faced boy
approvingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll you &rsquo;ave, cigar or
a cokernut?&rdquo;&nbsp; He staggered a little and caught the
back of the chair.</p>
<p><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>&ldquo;Hungry?&rdquo; asked West sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a good guesser,&rdquo; replied Bobbie, slipping
to the chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;I &rsquo;aven&rsquo;t had a thing to
eat for&mdash;for a day and a half.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Myddleton West snatched a serviette from the drawer and spread
it on the table in front of the boy.&nbsp; In another moment half
a loaf of bread, a knuckle of ham, and cheese were on the
serviette; in much less than another moment Bobbie had
commenced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me wolfin&rsquo; me food,&rdquo; said the boy
with his mouth full.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t suppose you know
what it is to be famishing.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had rather rough
times the last few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you went to the Poor Law schools surely.&nbsp; Did
you run away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bobbie ruefully.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I
wish now I hadn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Can I trouble you for a glass of
water, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like some lemonade?&rdquo; asked Myddleton West.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long as it&rsquo;s moist, sir, and there&rsquo;s
plenty of it, I don&rsquo;t mind what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re not getting on well as an independent
man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting on,&rdquo; said Bobbie, holding up
the glass with a trembling hand, &ldquo;pretty
awful.&rdquo;&nbsp; He drank and smacked his lips appreciatively,
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s something
like!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eat slowly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it matter if I finish the bread, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be disappointed if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then rather&rsquo;n cause you any annoyance,&rdquo;
said Bobbie with reviving spirits, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll undertake to
clear it all up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The meal finished, the boy asked for a cigarette, and, smoking
this with great enjoyment, told Myddleton West his
adventures.&nbsp; The journey back from Brenchley had not been
without drawbacks.&nbsp; At Orpington, Bobbie had interfered on
behalf of the gipsy&rsquo;s wife, with the perfectly natural
result that she had turned on him indignantly, and both man and
wife had, in turns, thrashed him, and had then started him adrift
without his cornet.&nbsp; From Orpington to London he had
walked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Bobbie&mdash;&ldquo;and now my
difficulty is how to get back to the &rsquo;omes without looking
a silly fool.&nbsp; What would you advise, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should send a wire,&rdquo; counselled Myddleton West
promptly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Apologize for your absence, and say that
you will be there in a few hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;d pave the way a bit,&rdquo; acknowledged the
boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a form.&nbsp; Write the address of the
Superintendent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must tell us what else to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The telegram drawn up on the dictation of the newspaper man,
seemed to Bobbie an admirable document; one calculated to remove
difficulties.&nbsp; Miss Langley being summoned, the boy was
conveyed to the kitchen downstairs, where, furnished with a cake
of yellow soap, he remained under the tap for about ten
minutes.&nbsp; This so much improved his appearance that when
Myddleton West started with him to take train at Blackfriars, the
two sisters forced upon his acceptance a triangular chunk of seed
cake and a gay almanack with a portrait of the Princess of Wales,
which Bobbie decided to take as a propitiatory offering to the
mother of Collingwood Cottage.&nbsp; The telegram was despatched
from an office in Fleet Street after Bobbie had read it through
once more with increased satisfaction.</p>
<p><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t too humble,&rdquo; he said
approvingly, &ldquo;and it ain&rsquo;t too much the other
way.&nbsp; Seems to me to hit the &rsquo;appy medium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fares from Temple Station to Bishopsgate and from
Liverpool Street to the destination being ascertained from a
railway time book, Bobbie agreed to accept from Myddleton West
the precise amount and no more.&nbsp; He showed gratitude with
less reserve than he would have exhibited in the years before he
entered the Homes, and, as he trotted beside the long-legged
journalist, he endeavoured politely to find a subject for
conversation that would be pleasing to his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you getting along with your young lady,
sir?&rdquo; he asked with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No progress,&rdquo; replied West.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t go the right way to work,&rdquo; said
Bobbie knowingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Women folk can be managed if you
only exercise a bit of what I call ingenuity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am always willing, Master Lancaster, to listen to the
voice of experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you want to do,&rdquo; said the young sage,
changing step as they went down Arundel Street, &ldquo;is to be
artful without lettin&rsquo; &rsquo;em see that you&rsquo;re
artful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know of no plan,&rdquo; said West, &ldquo;by which,
under modern conditions, you can force a lady to marry you if she
has decided not to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretend there&rsquo;s another lady,&rdquo; suggested
Bobbie;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always a risk that the announcement may be received
with undisguised satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can but give it a trial,&rdquo; urged Bobbie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If she&rsquo;s an ordinary sort of young lady, strikes me
she&rsquo;ll marry you like a shot.&nbsp; Is this my
station?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the Temple Station,&rdquo; said West.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Buy your ticket and be careful not to get out of the train
before you get to Bishopsgate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Bobbie.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
old enough to take care of meself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me know that you get down safely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be as right as rain now.&nbsp; I feel like
twenty shillings in the pound since I saw you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; said Myddleton West, holding out his
hand, &ldquo;and good luck to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; said Bobbie, taking the hand
awkwardly, &ldquo;and good luck to you, sir.&nbsp; You know what
I mean.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m very much obliged for
all your&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a train coming,&rdquo; interrupted
West.&nbsp; &ldquo;Down you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobbie, seated near the window of the impetuous underground
train, held tightly the large card intender for the mother of
Collingwood Cottage, and as he read advertisements in the
compartment congratulated himself on the change of circumstances
that had come to him within the last hour.&nbsp; He felt grateful
for this, and decided that once safely back in the homes and
enjoying the sunshine of favour again, he would comport himself
in a manner that would be gratifying to those who wished him
well.&nbsp; The bitter days of the journey up from Brenchley had
proved to him that the world was full of unforeseen and highly
inconvenient rocks for a boy who had no one to pilot him; he must
wait until he became older before he courted the responsibility
of taking charge of himself.&nbsp; In less than an hour he would
be through the gates of the Homes; the delicate matter of his
return would be all over, and the past few days could be sponged
from <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>memory.&nbsp; So far as concerned the underground
railway there could be no complaint of delay, for the train
seemed in a great hurry to get round the circle, stopping
momentarily at one or two stations in a breathless, panting
manner, as who should say, Oh, for goodness sake, don&rsquo;t
stop me, I&rsquo;m behind-hand as it is, some other time
I&rsquo;ll come round and stay, but just now really&mdash;</p>
<p>Other passengers in the compartment went out at one of the
stations, and Bobbie stood up at the open window as the train
hurried through the black smoky tunnel.&nbsp; The train pulled
up, gasping, at another station, starting again immediately with
a rough jerk that knocked the card out of Bobbie&rsquo;s hand on
to the platform.&nbsp; He jumped out, picked up the portrait and
attempted to re-enter the compartment.&nbsp; The porters
shouted,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stan&rsquo; away from the train there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stan&rsquo; away, can&rsquo;t you, stan&rsquo;
away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa!&nbsp; Stop!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll break the
door!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The train pulled up suddenly in a great state of
annoyance.&nbsp; At the end of the platform, where the black
tunnel began, the boy had been flung and lay a mere bundle on the
platform.&nbsp; The carriage door closed; the train went on into
the tunnel ill-temperedly.&nbsp; The entire staff and a few stray
passengers surrounded the senseless bundle on the platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said the inspector to one of the porters,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re a &lsquo;first aid&rsquo; man.&nbsp; See if
you can tell what the damage is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s &rsquo;urt,&rdquo; said the &ldquo;first
aid&rdquo; man, with a professional air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; remarked the inspector, &ldquo;we
could have all guessed that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a case for the &rsquo;ospital,&rdquo; said
the &ldquo;first aid&rdquo; man cautiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t feel justified in trying my &rsquo;and at
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the inspector, &ldquo;fetch the
ambulance cart, someone, for the poor little beggar, and
let&rsquo;s get him there as quick as possible.&nbsp; We
can&rsquo;t have passengers dying about here.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Into</span> a long broad ward with scarlet
counterpaned cots, headed against the wall on either side, and a
shining floor between, Bobbie Lancaster, after being with ever so
much tenderness bathed and combed in a small room, was conveyed,
and there he relinquished for a few weeks his identity and became
Number Twenty.&nbsp; The young doctor whom he saw when first
brought into the hospital had whistled softly, and had murmured
the words &ldquo;compound fracture&rdquo;; the damaged boy felt
glad that the injury was of some importance and likely to attract
attention.&nbsp; He woke the morning following his arrival on tea
being brought round at five o&rsquo;clock, to find that his arm,
accurately bound up with two small boards, gave him less pain
than be had expected.&nbsp; There was an acceptable scent of
cleanliness in the ward, helped sternly by the universal scent of
carbolic, receiving more joyful volunteer assistance from the
bowl of heliotrope on the Sister&rsquo;s table at the
centre.&nbsp; Turning his head, Bobbie saw a comfortable <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>fire blazing
away not far from him; a fire that made all polished things
reflect its flames; saw, too, that some of his neighbours were
unable to rise, and had to be fed by the white-aproned nurses
going softly to each cot.&nbsp; One or two of the numbers had
arched protectors under the bedclothes to keep the sheets from
touching their small bodies; Number Twenty-one had a head so
fully bandaged that there was not much of his face to be seen but
the eyes and the tip of a nose; wherefore he was called by the
others &ldquo;Fifth of November.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bobbie&rsquo;s
other immediate neighbour, Number Nineteen, a white-faced boy,
lost no time in bragging to the new-comer that he possessed hips
about as bad as hips could manage to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Twenty,&rdquo; said the nurse to Bobbie
cheerfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;You going to stay at our hotel for a few
weeks?&rdquo;&nbsp; The nurse was a pleasing round-faced young
woman, who signalled the approach of an ironical remark by
winking; in the absence of this intimation the ward understood
Nurse Crowther to be serious.&nbsp; &ldquo;All the nobility come
here,&rdquo; said Nurse Crowther, deflecting her eyelid,
&ldquo;seem to have given up Homburg and Wiesbaden and places,
and to have made up their mind to come to Margaret Ward.&nbsp;
Here&rsquo;s Lord Bailey, otherwise known as Nineteen, for
instance.&rdquo;&nbsp; The white-faced boy laughed at this
personal allusion.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s given up
everything,&rdquo; declared Nurse Crowther.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dances,
receptions, partridge shooting, and I don&rsquo;t know what all,
just in order that he should come and spend a few months here
with us.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t that right, Nineteen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gawspel!&rdquo; affirmed little Nineteen, in a
whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must affect some of the other fashionable
resorts,&rdquo; said Nurse Crowther, pursuing the facetious
vein.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m told that there&rsquo;s nobody at
Trouville this year, and as for Switzerland&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the time you&rsquo;re trying to be funny,&rdquo;
complained Master Lancaster, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re letting my milk
get cold.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you attend to bisness
first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope you&rsquo;re not going to be a tiresome
boy,&rdquo; said the nurse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must bring the Sister to see you presently.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve got a nice open face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;ve got an open face I can keep me mouth
shut,&rdquo; said Twenty, drinking his milk.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more than some of you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arm pretty comfortable this morning?&rdquo; asked the
nurse, good-temperedly, as she smoothed the scarlet
counterpane.&nbsp; &ldquo;Had a good night&rsquo;s rest?&nbsp;
Weren&rsquo;t disturbed by the noise of the traffic, were
you?&nbsp; What&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One at a time, one at a time,&rdquo; said Twenty
crossly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t answer forty thousand
blooming questions at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit back now, there&rsquo;s a dear, and keep as quiet
as you can till the doctors come round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time do they put in an appearance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, dear duke,&rdquo; said the nurse winking,
&ldquo;entirely depends upon you.&nbsp; You have but to say the
word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s one thing I can&rsquo;t stand
more&rsquo;n another,&rdquo; said the boy, settling himself down
cautiously, &ldquo;it is gels trying to be comic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young doctor with three or four men still younger, and all
of them endeavouring to look an incalculable age, paid their
visit to Margaret Ward in due course, and Bobbie felt indignant
because whereas they <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>stayed at the end of his bed but a
couple of minutes writing some casual marks on the blue form
pinned on the board above his head, at the next bed they ordered
a screen to be placed, and behind this they remained in
consultation over the white-faced little Nineteen for quite a
long time.&nbsp; When they had gone, Bobbie salved his jealousy
by telling Nineteen at once that Nineteen need not think himself
everybody, giving a long list of imaginary complaints that he
(Bobbie) had in the past suffered from, ranging in character from
a wart on the knuckles to complete paralysis of the right
side.&nbsp; This seemed to restrain any idea that Nineteen might
have had of exhibiting conceit, and that little chap contented
himself by offering to bet two to one in halfpennies that he
would he the next in the Margaret Ward to go.&nbsp; Bobbie forced
the odds to three to one, and then closed with the wager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be sorry,&rdquo; said white-faced
Nineteen, &ldquo;&rsquo;pon me word I shan&rsquo;t.&nbsp; It
can&rsquo;t be much worse than this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You be careful how you talk,&rdquo; advised
Bobbie.&nbsp; &ldquo;A man that&rsquo;s getting near to kicking
the bucket can&rsquo;t be too cautious of what he
says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Likely as not,&rdquo; said Nineteen, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll
he a jolly sight better than this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you tell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; said Nineteen, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll he a
rare old lark to watch and see what &rsquo;appens.&nbsp; I
&rsquo;eard a man arguin&rsquo; once in Victoria Park that those
what put up with a lot in this world, got it all their own way in
the next, and vicer verser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did he get to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; admitted Nineteen, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
all speculation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Little Nineteen yawned.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I feel bit tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take jolly good care what you&rsquo;re about, old
man,&rdquo; recommended Bobbie.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll look
jolly silly if you find yourself all at once in
&rsquo;ell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even that&rsquo;d be interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And hot,&rdquo; said Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t mind chancing it a bit,&rdquo; said
Nineteen, &ldquo;only there&rsquo;s the old woman.&nbsp; She
worries about me a good deal, she does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d he upset if she thought I hadn&rsquo;t gone
to &rsquo;Eaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nineteen gave the skeleton of a
laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know what Primitive Methodists
are,&rdquo; he added excusingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what,&rdquo; said Bobbie.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
anything &rsquo;appens to you and you pop off the hooks,
I&rsquo;ll tell her that you were going there all right, and
I&rsquo;ll make up something about angels, and say they was your
last words.&nbsp; See!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall take it very kind of you,&rdquo; said little
Nineteen thankfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You leave it me.&nbsp; And touchin&rsquo; that
bet.&nbsp; Just occurs to me.&nbsp; If you lose you mayn&rsquo;t
be able to pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I win I shan&rsquo;t be able to dror it off of
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Bobbie, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll see
what &rsquo;appens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never stole nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; urged
Nineteen, after a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right.&rdquo;&nbsp; With some
awkwardness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had a copper even speak to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re as right as ninepence.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
lots of cheps worse than you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to &rsquo;ave port wine and
jellies,&rdquo; remarked Nineteen after a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of you get all the luck,&rdquo; said Bobbie.&nbsp;
At which Nineteen dozed off contentedly.</p>
<p><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>When,
later in the morning, the tall young Sister came up to
Bobbie&rsquo;s cot and introduced herself, he permitted her to
talk for some time, and watched her quiet, attractive face.&nbsp;
Dressed in her plain gown, she looked, the boy thought, perfect,
and he touched the white hand that rested on the coverlet of his
bed with shy respect.&nbsp; Sister Margaret talked of his
accident; chatted about the other numbers of the ward.&nbsp;
Leaving him for a moment to give white-faced Nineteen a kiss, she
was called back by Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Twenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something to ask you.&nbsp; Bend down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the tall young woman obeyed, Bobbie put one hand to his
mouth in order that his confidential inquiry might not be heard
by the other boys.&nbsp; &ldquo;How&rsquo;s your young
man?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>Sister Margaret flushed and stood upright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Twenty?&rdquo; she answered,
severely.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must understand that here we
don&rsquo;t allow boys to be impudent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Miss,&rdquo; whispered
Bobbie.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fly all to pieces.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not chaffing of you.&nbsp; I mean Mr. West&mdash;Mr.
Myddleton West.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know Mr. West?&rdquo; she said, bending down
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather!&rdquo; said the boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Saw your
photograph in his place yesterday.&nbsp; Only one in the
room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat down beside the bed, her eyes taking a light of
interest.&nbsp; Bobbie looking round the ward to see that this
special honour was being noted, and observed that the numbers on
the opposite side scowled jealously at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known him off and on,&rdquo; said Bobbie,
&ldquo;these two or three years.&nbsp; Good sort, he
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. West is indeed a very good fellow,&rdquo; said the
Sister earnestly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you&mdash;you are wrong,
Twenty, in assuming that we are engaged.&nbsp; Nothing, in point
of fact, is further from the truth.&nbsp; We are very good
friends, and that is all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t kid me,&rdquo; said the boy
knowingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty!&nbsp; I shall be extremely annoyed if, whilst
you are in the ward, you couple my name with Mr.
West&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t think of doing so, Sister,&rdquo; he
said seriously.&nbsp; &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s one thing I can do
better than another it is keeping a secret.&nbsp; Once I make up
my mind to shut my mouth, wild &rsquo;orses wouldn&rsquo;t open
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like him,&rdquo; she went on (it appeared that the
Sister was not averse to speaking of Myddleton West), &ldquo;I
like him very much, but it is possible to like a person, Twenty,
without going so far as to become engaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depends!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are several courses open nowadays to
women,&rdquo; she said half to herself, and with something of
enthusiasm.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is no longer marriage or nothing for
them.&nbsp; There are certain duties in the world&mdash;public
duties&mdash;that a woman can take upon herself, and marriage
would only interfere with their performance.&nbsp; The old idea
of woman&rsquo;s place in the world was, to my mind, not quite
decent.&nbsp; We are getting away from all that, and we are
coming to see that the possibilities&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t he mind your taking up with this
nonsense?&rdquo; asked Bobbie.&nbsp; The boy&rsquo;s interruption
stopped the argumentative young woman.&nbsp; She <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>laughed
brightly at finding herself lecturing to Twenty on this subject,
and, smoothing his pillow before she went, asked him with a smile
whether he did not agree with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I call it a silly ass of an idea,&rdquo; he said
frankly.</p>
<p>This was not the last talk that he had with the tall young
Sister of the ward, and for some days in that week the ward
inclined to mutiny on account of the disproportionate time that
she gave to Twenty and to little Nineteen.&nbsp; It almost seemed
that Nineteen showed signs of improvement under the combined
influence of her visits and the companionship of Bobbie his
neighbour; Bobbie&rsquo;s predecessor had been a gloomy boy, with
his own views in regard to details of eternal torments, and
Bobbie&rsquo;s optimism cheered the white-faced boy so much that
when his tearful mother came to see him, being by special
permission admitted at any time, she found herself debating with
him on his walk in life when he should grow up, and discussing
the relative advantages of the position of engine-driver as
compared with that of policeman.&nbsp; Nineteen introducing his
neighbour, Nineteen&rsquo;s mother gave Bobbie two oranges and an
illuminated card bearing minatory texts.&nbsp; Bobbie enjoyed the
oranges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s better, nurse,&rdquo; said
Nineteen&rsquo;s mother respectfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Seems to have
got more colour, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my belief,&rdquo; answered Nurse Crowther at
the foot of the bed, &ldquo;that there&rsquo;s nothing whatever
the matter with his lordship.&nbsp; I believe it&rsquo;s all his
nonsense.&nbsp; I tell him that he&rsquo;ll have to take me to
the theatre some evening, soon as ever he gives up playing this
game of lying in bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Nineteen smiled faintly.&nbsp; The good-humoured nurse
went and placed her cool hand on his forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hold with theatres, nurse,&rdquo; said
Nineteen&rsquo;s mother precisely.&nbsp; &ldquo;To my mind chapel
is a great deal better than all these devil&rsquo;s
playhouses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dam sight duller,&rdquo; remarked Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m surprised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, nurse,&rdquo; said Bobbie excusingly, &ldquo;she
said &lsquo;devil.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; remarked Nurse Crowther,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to dodge off somewhere, the very first
day he gets well, aren&rsquo;t we, Nineteen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Happy nod of acquiescence from the tired boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we shan&rsquo;t say anything to anybody else about
it, shall we, Nineteen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not a word, signalled poor Nineteen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, goodness! how people will stare when they see us
on the steamer together off to Rosherville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come with you,&rdquo; interposed Bobbie from
the next bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not likely,&rdquo; declared Nurse Crowther, with
another wink.&nbsp; &ldquo;Two&rsquo;s company, three&rsquo;s a
crowd.&nbsp; Aye, Nineteen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most decidedly,&rdquo; intimated the delighted boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now it&rsquo;s time for your little
pick-me-up.&nbsp; Say good-bye to your mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nineteen&rsquo;s mother, having said good-bye, drew the nurse
aside, whispering a question, and Bobbie heard the answer,
&ldquo;No hope!&rdquo;&nbsp; This startled Bobbie, and made him
think; presently he worked so hard in the endeavour to cheer
little Nineteen that Sister Margaret had to command silence,
because Nineteen required rest.&nbsp; That night, when the ward
was silent, Bobbie watched him as he lay with eyes closed, his
breathing short <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>and irregular, and for almost the first time in his
life, Bobbie thought seriously of the desirability&mdash;taking
everything into consideration&mdash;of becoming religious.</p>
<p>He could see the red fire, and watching it he considered this
entirely new suggestion.&nbsp; He lifted the bed-clothes to
shield himself from the sight of the distant fireplace, for he
was becoming heated.&nbsp; It required much determination to put
gloomy thoughts from him; when he had partly succeeded in doing
this he looked again at the fire, and then he knew that there
were tears in his eyes, because the light of the fire became
starry and confused in appearance.&nbsp; He sniffed and rubbed
his eyes.&nbsp; It seemed that he could see another fire, a small
one, near to the grate, and this he assumed to be an optical
delusion until it crept along a black rug and commenced to blaze,
whereupon he slipped cautiously out of bed; his bandaged arm
paining, despite his care, and called for the nurse.&nbsp; An
answer did not come immediately, and the boy hurried bare-footed,
in his scarlet gown only, across the floor to the burning
rug.&nbsp; Afterwards, he remembered rolling it up awkwardly with
one hand and stamping upon it; the night nurse hurrying up with a
scream, forty heads up in forty cots&mdash;it was then for the
first and last time in his life that Bobbie fainted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall have to send you to a home,
Twenty.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sister Margaret looked on a day or two
later, whilst Nurse Crowther re-bound the lint and wool.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A convalescent home down by the sea-side, upon a hill,
where you can watch the shipping, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll suit me down to the ground,
Sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe he got burnt purposely, Sister,&rdquo;
declared Nurse Crowther, &ldquo;so that he should have a nice
long holiday.&nbsp; Wish to goodness I was half as artful as
Twenty is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Sister Margaret sedately,
&ldquo;that Twenty is a very brave boy.&nbsp; If it hadn&rsquo;t
been for his courage there might have been quite a serious
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twenty blushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty has qualities,&rdquo; went on the tall Sister,
&ldquo;that if properly directed&mdash;I should bring it twice
over the knee, nurse, I think&mdash;will make him a fine young
fellow, and a credit to his country.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sister Margaret
had raised her voice in order that her words might be
heard.&nbsp; The ward listened alertly; little Nineteen, whose
eyelids were now very tired, moving his head in order to
hear.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wrongly directed,&rdquo; she said, lowering
her voice, &ldquo;they will only make him dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should rather like to grow up and&mdash;and be
brave,&rdquo; said little Nineteen from the next bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you shall,&rdquo; declared Nurse Crowther, cheerily,
&ldquo;so you shall, Nineteen.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t get the
Victoria Cross some day, Nineteen, never believe me
again.&rdquo;&nbsp; Little Nineteen consoled, closed his eyes
wearily.&nbsp; &ldquo;As for you, Marquis,&rdquo; went on Nurse
Crowther, pinning the end of the roll with which Bobbie&rsquo;s
limb had been enveloped, &ldquo;I believe that what Sister says
is perfectly true.&nbsp; If you can only keep on the main line
you&rsquo;ll make a capital journey.&nbsp; Only don&rsquo;t get
branching off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t get along in the world,&rdquo; said
Bobbie, with a touch of his old impudence, &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t
he for the want of telling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be grateful, my Lord Bishop,&rdquo; said
Nurse Crowther, adjusting the bed-clothes carefully, &ldquo;that
you&rsquo;ve got so many friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me!&rdquo; echoed the boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, I
ain&rsquo;t got a friend in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>&ldquo;Twenty!&rdquo; said Sister Margaret
reprovingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And Mr. West is coming all the way down
here next visiting day specially to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To see me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sister Margaret, a little unsteadily,
&ldquo;to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon,&rdquo; said the boy, looking up,
&ldquo;he&rsquo;s going to kill two birds with one stone.&nbsp;
What he&rsquo;s really coming for is to see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty,&rdquo; she commanded,
&ldquo;silence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is to-morrow visiting day?&rdquo; asked the thin voice
of Nineteen, sleepily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; replied Nurse Crowther.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And mind you&rsquo;re nice and bright, Saucy Face, by
three o&rsquo;clock against your mother comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the ward the next day occurred the usual excitement that
preceded an afternoon for visitors.&nbsp; Little Nineteen alone
uninterested; it almost seemed that he had ceased to take concern
in worldly matters such as the arrival of apples and other
contraband, and to be content, when not asleep, with staring very
hard at the ceiling.&nbsp; Bobbie himself, cheered by receipt of
a kindly note from Collingwood Cottage, gave his best endeavours
to the task of enlivening Nineteen (&ldquo;Sop me
goodness,&rdquo; said Bobbie, reproachfully to himself, &ldquo;if
I ain&rsquo;t getting fond of the little beggar&rdquo;), but with
no result.&nbsp; Elsewhere in the ward movement and expectation;
Sister Margaret and the nurses had trouble to preserve sanity
amongst the boy patients.&nbsp; Thirty-five declared privately
his opinion that all the clocks were slow; that someone had put
them back on purpose; Thirty-five added darkly that if he could
find the person responsible for the deed he would make it a
County Court job.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the hour presently struck,
and two minutes afterwards came the sound of many footsteps in
the passage; the swing doors opened, and the visitors marched in
under the narrow inspection of every scarlet-gowned occupant of
every scarlet-counterpaned bed.&nbsp; There were sounds of
kissing in different parts of the ward.&nbsp; Bobbie ordered
Nineteen to wake up and look sharp about it, but little Nineteen
did not answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, Miss, is there a boy named Robert
Lancaster in this ward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobbie&rsquo;s head came up.&nbsp; Nurse Crowther pointed him
out to a young girl, dressed quietly, her hair rolled up into a
neat bunch, and wearing brown gloves fiercely new.&nbsp; She
carried a small paper bag, and looked casually at her silver
watch as she advanced to the bedside of Twenty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ho!&rdquo; said Bobbie, not unkindly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who sent for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother told me I might come,&rdquo; said Miss Trixie
Bell, breathlessly, &ldquo;and mother sent this bunch of the best
grapes she could get in Spitalfields Market, and mother said I
was to give you her kind regards, and tell you to get well as
soon as you could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Left to meself,&rdquo; said Bobbie, &ldquo;I should
never &rsquo;ave thought of that.&nbsp; They ain&rsquo;t so dusty
them grapes, though, are they?&rdquo; he added, admiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should rather think not,&rdquo; said Trixie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They cost money.&nbsp; How&rsquo;s your arm?&nbsp; You
look nice and neat in your scarlet&mdash;&rdquo; Miss Bell
checked herself and bit her lips.&nbsp; &ldquo;I nearly said
bed-gown,&rdquo; she remarked, apologetically, taking out her
watch again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve altered,&rdquo; said Bobbie, &ldquo;since
you came to see me last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother says I&rsquo;m going to grow up tall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care you don&rsquo;t grow up silly the same
time.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;d you get your watch from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy your noticing,&rdquo; said Trixie Bell,
delightedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s new <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>to-day.&nbsp;
Mother gave it me because it was my birthday, and I&rsquo;d
helped nicely with the shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many &rsquo;appy returns,&rdquo; he said, gruffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Bobbie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever see anything of them Drysdale Street
bounders?&nbsp; I mean Nose and Libbis and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never take no notice of nobody,&rdquo; said the young
lady, precisely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mother says its best to ignore them
altogether.&nbsp; Mother says its unwise even to pass the time of
day.&nbsp; So when they call out after me, I simply walk on as
though I hadn&rsquo;t &rsquo;eard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Bobbie,
approvingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your neighbour&rsquo;s asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little beggar&rsquo;s always at it.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll
wake up directly when his mother comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A scent of flowers and a familiar deep voice.&nbsp; Trixie,
who had been resting one elbow on the pillow, drew back, as
Myddleton West came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, young man,&rdquo; said Myddleton West, cheerily,
&ldquo;how are we getting on?&nbsp; Sister Margaret has been
telling me of your fire brigade exploit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might have been, apparently, if you had not acted as
you did.&nbsp; This a friend of yours?&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss Bell
stood up and bowed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve met you two
together before.&nbsp; On a tram going Shoreditch way on the
night when&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let bygones be bygones,&rdquo; said Bobbie,
uneasily.&nbsp; &ldquo;That was ages ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you were mere boy and girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesso!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister Margaret thinks of getting you away to a
convalescent home,&rdquo; said Myddleton West.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to have had a rare old chat with her,&rdquo;
said the boy, pointedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give her them flowers,
instead of leaving them here.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll please
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; interrupted Trixie,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think you ought to call the nurse for this
little chap in the next bed?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve just touched his
hand, and somehow&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nurse Crowther and another nurse come quickly to the bed of
Nineteen.&nbsp; Nurse Crowther flies for the screen; when this is
fixed around the bed, a doctor is sent for.&nbsp; The doctor
hurries in, goes away directly, but the screen remains.&nbsp;
Nineteen&rsquo;s mother arriving tardily with oranges for her
boy, is admitted behind the screen, and there comes presently the
sound of weeping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t he woke up, Nurse?&rdquo; asks Bobbie,
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly time for visitors to go,&rdquo; says Nurse
Crowther.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon have to say
good-bye.&nbsp; Nice bright day outside, they tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t he woke up yet, Nurse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who, your Highness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Nineteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For once Nurse Crowther&rsquo;s wink declines to respond to
her summons.&nbsp; Her lips move, and she puts her hand up to
control them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My chick,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;Nineteen won&rsquo;t
wake again in this world.&rdquo;&nbsp; The bed clothes go quickly
over Bobbie&rsquo;s head, and remain there for <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>some few
minutes.&nbsp; When Sister Margaret&rsquo;s voice is heard
warning visitors of the approach of half-past four, his head
reappears rather shamefacedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trixie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Bobbie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody looking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; whispers Bobbie, &ldquo;if you like to
bend down, you can give me a kiss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Bell takes sedate advantage of this offer, and,
readjusting her hat, when she has done so, finds her bright brown
gloves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Bobbie,&rdquo; says Miss Bell.&nbsp; Then
she adds very softly, &ldquo;Dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so much of the &lsquo;dear,&rsquo;&rdquo; orders
Bobbie.</p>
<h2><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> seaside institution to which
Bobbie, with an attention that could not have been exceeded if he
had been paying money recklessly to everybody around him, found
himself conveyed, exactly fitted his desires.&nbsp; The cool,
calm order of the place, the quiet service of serene women
attendants in their dark gowns and white aprons, the well-chosen
table, the pure white linen in spotless bedrooms&mdash;all these
things, that might have irritated the boy had he been perfectly
well, were, in his convalescent state, precisely what he
required.&nbsp; The days had become warmer, and it was possible
to spend a good deal of time on the wooden balconies of the
Swiss-like building.&nbsp; From these balconies he could look
away across the green waters, with their patches of dark purple;
could watch the Channel steamer puffing its way across, presently
to enter the harbour below.&nbsp; The harbour itself never ceased
to delight him.&nbsp; There it was that steamers rested in a
dignified manner when off duty, submitting themselves to an
energetic washing of decks and rubbing of brasswork; near them,
brown-sailed fishing vessels for ever going out to sea or coming
back from sea, manned by limited crews, who shouted in the
dialect of the Kentish coast, and whose aim in life it appeared
to be not so much to do work themselves as to tell others to do
it.&nbsp; The scent of the sea came up to the balconies, and most
of the boys in varying stages of repair who inhaled it, declared
their intention, once they had regained possession of that health
which for the moment eluded them, of becoming admirals in her
Majesty&rsquo;s navy.&nbsp; Bobbie Lancaster on this subject said
nothing, which was his way when engaged in making up his
mind.</p>
<p>Stages marked the progress of improvement.&nbsp; One of the
earliest came on permission being granted to walk about the
green-grassed lawn around the Home, with its summer-houses,
where, over the fence in the evenings, you could observe sons of
mariners wooing, with economic speech, daughters of other
mariners, and kissing them, under the impression that no one but
a Martello tower looked on.</p>
<p>Here Bobbie himself fell in love.</p>
<p>A breezy curate attached to the church close by, for ever
flying in and out of the Home with no hat, and an appearance of
having another engagement of a highly urgent character for which
he was a little late, hurried in one day to look round the
sitting-room where the guests played dominoes, and found Bobbie
well enough to go out; so well, indeed, that he had arranged to
go down the long road towards the white cliffs in company with an
adult patient, who, being in ordinary times a stoker on <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>a London
Bridge and Greenwich steamboat, posed as authority on all matters
concerning the navy, and arbitrator in disputes concerning that
branch of the service.&nbsp; Breezy Curate, in less than no time
at all, found other work for the naval authority, gained the
necessary permission from the Lady Superintendent, and was away
with Bobbie, walking so fast that he had to run back now and then
in the manner of a frisky terrier, in order that Bobbie should
keep up with him.&nbsp; Ere the boy had time or breath to ask
questions they arrived at the door of a round squat Martello
tower (called by elderly acquaintances Billy Pitt&rsquo;s
Mansion), where he was lugged in and introduced to the
coastguardsman who lived there; introduced also to
coastguardsman&rsquo;s immense niece, who appeared to Bobbie,
panting on a chair, like a very large angel, only better dressed
and much better looking, and who, it appeared, came in daily to
make tidy her uncle&rsquo;s tower.&nbsp; Breezy Curate, before
hastening off for a fly along the cliffs, made the boy a friend
of Coastguard and Coastguard&rsquo;s niece, and promised to call
back for him in an hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon you&rsquo;ve been &rsquo;avin&rsquo; games,
young man, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Coastguard sternly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What made you fall down and step on yerself in that manner
for, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobbie explained.&nbsp; When he described the fire in Margaret
Ward, the large angel, making tea and toasting bread that filled
the small room with most appetizing odours, looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo,&rdquo; said the young woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come
here and I&rsquo;ll give ye a kiss for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobbie hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, lad,&rdquo; counselled her uncle;
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s them that wouldn&rsquo;t want to be asked
twice to do that, jigger me if they would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle!&rdquo; said the large angel reprovingly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do give over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobbie considered it proof of the young woman&rsquo;s angelic
nature that, seeing he did not stir, she came to him,
toasting-fork in hand, gave him a hug and then went back to her
work at the fire.&nbsp; Coastguard, enormously amused at this,
slapped his knee, saying that seeing kisses were cheap, jigger
him if he wouldn&rsquo;t have one, and a kiss he therefore took,
and the three sat down to tea in great good-humour.&nbsp; By an
effort, Bobbie determined to retain the correct behaviour that he
had learnt in the Cottage Homes and at Margaret Ward; Coastguard,
delighted with the boy&rsquo;s respectful manner, declared that
an earl could not comport himself better.&nbsp; From this,
Coastguard passed, by easy transition, to a review of the Royal
Family of his country, a review that became a glowing
eulogy.&nbsp; The angel, too, preparing to cut cake, expressed so
much affection for the younger members of the family, portraits
of whom were on the walls of the little room of the Martello
tower, that the boy found himself impressed, and convinced by
views in regard to Royalty that were novel to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Lady,&rdquo; declared Coastguard, blowing at his
tea, &ldquo;will have the best.&nbsp; She don&rsquo;t mind what
she pays for her Navy, but she will &rsquo;ave it
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what you mean,&rdquo; said Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like the outside or the inside?&rdquo; asked the
angel at the cake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both, Miss,&rdquo; said Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of your ne&rsquo;er-do-wells for her,&rdquo; went
on Coastguard.&nbsp; &ldquo;None of your
thieving&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve dropped your knife on the floor,
little boy,&rdquo; said the angel.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a
sign you&rsquo;re not careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;None of your bad characters, none of your
criminals for my Navy,&rsquo; she ses, &lsquo;if you
please.&rsquo;&nbsp; And jigger me,&rdquo; said Coastguard
explosively, &ldquo;jigger me if the old Lady ain&rsquo;t
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to call her &lsquo;Her Majesty,&rsquo;
uncle.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d look silly if she happened to be
listening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go&rsquo; bless my soul,&rdquo; said Coastguard with
enthusiasm, &ldquo;she wouldn&rsquo;t mind it from me.&nbsp; She
knows my way of talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; stammered Bobbie, &ldquo;is it&mdash;is it
true then that you can&rsquo;t get into the Navy if you&rsquo;ve
done anything wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Devil a bit,&rdquo; answered Coastguard.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Old Lady&rsquo;d think it was a piece of impudence to try
it on.&nbsp; Looey, my gell, whilst I&rsquo;m havin&rsquo; my
pipe jest give us a toon on the old harmonium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The large niece, seated at the harmonium, seemed, to the
thoughtful Bobbie, more like an angel than ever; the music she
produced helped to distract his troubled thoughts.&nbsp;
Presently, however, the angel found a Moody and Sankey book and,
having propped it on the ledge before her, picked out on the keys
as with her foot she moved the pedals, a hymn that gave the boy
memories.&nbsp; The Coastguard rolled his head to the rhythm; now
and again taking his pipe from his mouth to growl a note or two
and thus give his niece encouragement.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dare to be a Daniel,<br />
Dare to stand alone,<br />
Dare to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bobbie sat forward in his chair, his eyes fixed on the broad
bending back of the young lady at the harmonium, and thought of
Ely Place.&nbsp; What a long way off Ely Place seemed now; Bat
Miller, and Mrs. Bat Miller, and the Fright; all these were misty
figures that for years had visited his memory infrequently.&nbsp;
Bat Miller&rsquo;s time would be up in a year or two.&nbsp;
Bobbie shivered to think what he should do were Bat
Miller&rsquo;s face to appear suddenly at the window.&nbsp; For a
few moments he dared not glance at the window, fearful that this
impossible event might happen; when at the end of the hymn he
nerved himself to look in that direction he felt almost surprised
to find no face peering in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gi&rsquo; us,&rdquo; said the Coastguard cheerfully,
&ldquo;Gi&rsquo; us &lsquo;Old the Fort.&rsquo;&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s the one I&rsquo;m gone on.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a
swing about &lsquo;Old the Fort.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to the boy that already he had lived two lives; that
the first had been broken off short on the day he turned out of
Worship Street Police Court.&nbsp; He could not help feeling a
vague admiration for that first boy because the first boy had
been a fine young dare-devil, never trammelled by rules of
behaviour; at the same time it was as well, perhaps, that the
first boy had ceased to live, for he was not the kind of lad
Bobbie could have introduced to the angel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said the Coastguard, &ldquo;jigger my
eyes if I mustn&rsquo;t on with my jacket and find my spy-glass
and see what&rsquo;s going on outside.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s that
young curate got to, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Coastguard went presently, after telling Bobbie that he
might call again at the Martello tower, and that if he behaved he
should one day go <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>out to the Coastguard Station and see, by aid of the
telescope, the coast of France.&nbsp; Bobbie, alone with the
angel, and allowed to seat himself at the end of the harmonium,
behaved with a preciseness and a decorum that in any other lad
would have been held by Bobbie as good justification for punching
that boy&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; The angel&rsquo;s right hand
remaining on the higher keys for a space in order to give full
effect to a final chord, he bent and kissed it.&nbsp; The scent
of brown Windsor soap ever afterwards reminded him of this first
essay in affection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ye up to?&rdquo; demanded the angel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only kissin&rsquo; your &rsquo;and,&rdquo; said Bobbie
confusedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t kiss hands down in these parts,&rdquo;
said the large young lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t Kentish
fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like you,&rdquo; remarked the boy shyly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My goodness!&rdquo; said the angel with affectation of
much concern, &ldquo;this won&rsquo;t do.&nbsp; I mustn&rsquo;t
be catched alone with a young man what says things like
that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d better be seeing about taking you back to
the home, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curate not returning (having, as it proved, flown away to
a neighbouring parish and forgotten all about the boy), this
course had to be adopted, and the two walked back along the road
on the edge of the white cliffs&mdash;Bobbie in a state of proud
ecstasy, which reached its highest point, when a boy, in passing
them, called out to him, &ldquo;Why doan&rsquo; you marry the
girl?&rdquo;&nbsp; The angel herself spoke of the amount that the
starting of a household cost; of the relative advantages of a
house with folding doors but no bay windows, compared with a
house having bay windows, but no folding doors; all in a manner
that seemed to the boy, strutting by her side, highly
encouraging, and, under the circumstances, as much as on such
brief acquaintance a man could reasonably expect.&nbsp; At the
home, any trouble that might have arisen by reason of the
boy&rsquo;s extended absence was removed by the fact that the
angel had once been a highly-esteemed servant at the Institution;
the Lady Superintendent met them without a frown.&nbsp; The large
young lady found herself lugged into the kitchen by two of the
white-aproned maids for a chat, and when presently she looked in
to say good night, at the reading-room where Bobbie was finishing
a sea story, she kissed him, to the great envy of the other
convalescent young students.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serve us all alike, Miss,&rdquo; begged a lad with
crutches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You be quiet,&rdquo; ordered Bobbie, &ldquo;unless you
want your head punched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me &rsquo;alf a one,&rdquo; urged the lad with
crutches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fear,&rdquo; said the angel cheerfully.&nbsp; She
nodded her head to Bobbie.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s my young
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should have thought you&rsquo;d got better taste,
Miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You leave off talking to that lady,&rdquo; growled
Bobbie, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll spoil your features for
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; The large young lady waved her hand and
disappeared through the swing doors.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you
ain&rsquo;t a gentleman, do, for goodness sake, try to &rsquo;ide
the fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the few weeks of Bobbie&rsquo;s residence, the Coastguard
became his very good friend.&nbsp; The boy learned the secrets of
flags, listened with an interest that he had never felt at school
to the accounts of British victories by sea in the past,
absorbing with great appetite the Coastguard&rsquo;s figures
illustrating the current state of the Navy.&nbsp; In his young
heart patriotism was born.</p>
<p><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>Permitted to see through the telescope the coast of
France, he commenced to realize actualities that he had never
gained from maps.&nbsp; In the school of the Cottage Homes the
general impression amongst incredulous small boys had been that
no such places as foreign countries really existed; that these
were fictions invented by adults for the more complete annoyance
and trouble of children.&nbsp; Now the line of cliffs where on
bright days tiny black specks could be seen moving, brought
conviction; the boy found that he had much to learn, and
something to forget.&nbsp; One Sunday afternoon, being allowed to
go down to the sleeping harbour, and over the line, and along the
quay by the Customs House, he met, by happy chance, the angel, in
white, with green sunshade, who, it appeared, waited for some one
who would be free as soon as the baggage had been cleared;
together they watched the Channel steamer bustle in and wake up
the harbour, saw ropes thrown, gangways fixed, and presently
heard the arriving passengers chattering in a language which the
angel told him was French.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ignorant set, ain&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; asked
Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the large young
lady tolerantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;aven&rsquo;t got much opinion of
foreigners,&rdquo; said the boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;For one thing, why
don&rsquo;t they learn a decent language like ourn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose they get on all right without
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know any French?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bit,&rdquo; said the angel modestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us some!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Je vous aime,&rdquo; said the angel.&nbsp; On Bobbie
demanding a translation, the large young lady, shading her face
with the green parasol, furnished this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who learnt it you?&rdquo; demanded Bobbie
jealously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the angel acutely, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
tellings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It galled him considerably on the last occasion that the
breezy young curate took him under his wing to fly away with him
along the cliff and look in at the Martello tower for a picture
of a ship which the Coastguard had promised to him, to find the
small room almost wholly occupied by a tall bashful young Customs
officer, with limbs so long that when he sat down his knees came
up in a manner which Bobbie considered eminently
ridiculous.&nbsp; The angel had not arrived, but was expected;
when the curate insisted upon Bobbie coming away with him, his
picture of the ship under his arm, in order that they might skirt
the cliffs swallow-like once more, Bobbie complied with
hesitation, being thus denied the joy of seeing the lady of his
heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to stay &rsquo;ere all me bloomin&rsquo;
lifetime,&rdquo; said Bobbie to the Lady Superintendent that
night.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the next day he had to listen to the voice of
reasonableness, to pack up the books that had been given him by
the curate, the picture that Coastguard had presented, and a
marvellous four-bladed knife from the angel, for which he had
paid to that young lady the sum of one halfpenny, in order that
the knife might not, in its keenness, sever friendship.&nbsp; He
said good-bye to the Lady Superintendent, remembering (just in
time) to say, &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; a phrase with which he had
become on intimate terms, and walked stolidly down to the
station, where a train would take him back to London and the
Homes.&nbsp; As he looked at the contents of the bookstall (he
had begun in those days to feel an appetite <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>for reading,
and a strange craving when not furnished with something in the
form of printed words) to him appeared:&mdash;</p>
<p>First, the angel!&nbsp; Bobbie had felt confident that the
large young lady would not allow him to depart without giving him
an opportunity of formally declaring his love; he had already
decided on the form of his address.</p>
<p>Second, the curate!&nbsp; Curate flying in through the booking
office, skimming restlessly up and down the platform, chatting
with porters, chucking babies under the chin, and telling the
station-master how a railway ought to be managed.</p>
<p>Third, Coastguard.&nbsp; Jiggering everything at frequent
intervals; handing over to Bobbie as final gifts a parcel of huge
ham sandwiches and a model clockwork steamer.</p>
<p>Fourth, as the train signalled from the preceding station, an
entirely unnecessary person in the shape of the tall Customs
officer, rather shy, but taking up, as it seemed to Bobbie, the
unwarrantable attitude of being a friend of the family, and
brushing from the angel&rsquo;s brown cape a few specks of dust
with a calmness for which Bobbie, circumstances willing, could
have felled him to the platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said Bobbie, leaning out of the carriage
window, when he had been helped into the train, &ldquo;I want to
speak to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; asked the Customs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; said Bobbie, with infinite scorn.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Good &rsquo;Eavens, no.&nbsp; I mean her.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
angel stepped forward.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want to ask you
something,&rdquo; he said rather unsteadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what it is,&rdquo; declared the angel
gaily.&nbsp; &ldquo;You want me to remember to send you some of
the cake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What cake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, as if you didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the angel
reproachfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, my weddin&rsquo; cake, of
course.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t say you haven&rsquo;t heard that me and
him,&rdquo; indicating the tall Customs officer, &ldquo;are going
to be married next month at&mdash;.&nbsp; Now you&rsquo;re
off.&nbsp; Good-bye, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be a good lad,&rdquo; cried Coastguard, as the train
moved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be sure to get out at Cannon Street,&rdquo; called the
curate, flying along the platform, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t forget
to say your prayers at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When, two hours later, the train ran into the London terminus,
porters surveyed with critical eye each compartment, and having
made hurried selections, staked out their claim by seizing a
carriage handle as they trotted along till the train
stopped.&nbsp; Bobbie, rather ill-tempered on the journey because
his affairs of the heart had been so brutally checked, had his
head out of the window as the train slowed up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any luggage?&rdquo; asked the porter breathlessly.</p>
<p>Bobbie shook his head, and the porter hurried on in search of
a more encumbered traveller.&nbsp; Bobbie, walking down the
crowded platform to the barrier, found the word luggage remaining
in his mind.&nbsp; It recalled evenings with Bat Miller at
stations on the other side of the City, followed sometimes by an
interesting review of the contents of a portmanteau or a
lady&rsquo;s dressing-case in Ely Place.&nbsp; Around the
guard&rsquo;s van, now disgorging its contents hurriedly and
confusedly, passengers stood as though at an auction, and when
they saw an article of luggage in tune with their desires, held
up a hand, and the article being knocked down to them, they bore
it off without further question.&nbsp; In the centre, one of the
busy <a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>porters acting as auctioneer held up a bright brown
portmanteau with initials painted boldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody claim this?&rdquo; demanded the harried
porter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Anybody claim a bag with&mdash;.&nbsp; A
bundle of rugs, lady?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll look after it in
&rsquo;alf a moment, if you&rsquo;ll only leave off prodding me
in the back with that gamp of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want,&rdquo; said Bobbie&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;a bag
marked L. C. E.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; grumbled the porter, handing it over to
Bobbie, &ldquo;&rsquo;ere &rsquo;ave I been the last five minutes
trying to find a owner for it?&nbsp; Want a cab?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bobbie, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll carry
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit lumpy,&rdquo; remarked the porter
warningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>
<p>He gave up his ticket at the barrier and lugged the heavy bag
across to a departure platform.</p>
<p>It was, as the porter had said, a heavy bag, and anxious as
the boy felt to get away with it, he found himself obliged to
rest for a moment when he had reached the platform.&nbsp; Then he
started on again, the heavy portmanteau bumping against his
knee.&nbsp; Through his alert little head a scheme had already
danced; a scheme necessitating an empty compartment to permit of
a selection from the articles which the bag contained, and the
disposal of the bag itself.&nbsp; This would have the advantage
of deferring the awkward duty of returning to the Cottage Homes
that day.&nbsp; A nurse walked by on the platform, with flowing
cloak and white bands; Bobbie&rsquo;s mind was recalled to Sister
Margaret.&nbsp; From Sister Margaret his thoughts went to his
other friends.&nbsp; He sat down on the portmanteau; his breath
came quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d all look pretty straight,&rdquo; he said
to himself, &ldquo;if they knew.&rdquo;&nbsp; He rose slowly, and
gripped the stout leather handles of the bag.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Owever, I ain&rsquo;t going to be copped.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s plenty that do a thing like this quietly and never
so much as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped.&nbsp; Across the line on the wall a large portrait
in an advertisement frame had&mdash;a cloud of engine smoke
disappearing&mdash;come into view.&nbsp; Bobbie stared at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old Lady,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>The portrait of her Majesty the Queen of England and Great
Britain looked across at Bobbie with, as it seemed to him, a look
of surprise, mingled with reproof.&nbsp; A train whistled, a
ticket collector shouted, &ldquo;North Kent train to
Blackheath,&rdquo; but the boy did not move.&nbsp; When the train
had started, and the smoke had cleared away, Bobbie found his
attention still held by the portrait on the other platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old Lady,&rdquo; he quoted, under his breath,
&ldquo;will &rsquo;ave the best.&nbsp; She don&rsquo;t mind what
she pays for her navy, but she will &rsquo;ave it good.&nbsp;
None of your criminals for her navy, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started up, his face white and perspiring.&nbsp; Lugging
the weighty portmanteau back to the arrival barrier, he staggered
determinedly through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what,&rdquo; a young officer lad was saying
fiercely.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you porters don&rsquo;t find that
fearful bag of mine I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Scuse me,&rdquo; interrupted Bobbie, placing the
portmanteau at the feet of its owner.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
mistake.&nbsp; Took it off in the hurry, instead of me
own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really most fearfully obliged,&rdquo;
declared the officer lad effusively.&nbsp; <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>&ldquo;It has
my dress suit, don&rsquo;t you know, and I should have looked
such a fearfully silly fool this evening without it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re saved from that now, sir,&rdquo; said the
inspector, pointedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I mean to say is, I&rsquo;m so fearfully indebted
to you that really&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t name it,&rdquo; said Bobbie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Glad I brought it back in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, old chap,&rdquo; said the officer lad,
shaking hands with the boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m most fearfully
glad to have met you.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t give you a lift, I
suppose, anywhere, can I, what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, fearfully,&rdquo; said Bobbie.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
brougham&rsquo;s waiting outside for me.&nbsp; Ta-ta!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Roses</span> at Collingwood upon his
return; and thorns.&nbsp; Thorns supplied, not by the
foster-father or the foster-mother, but by the boys, who, once
they had extracted full particulars of Bobbie&rsquo;s adventure,
made from these facts ammunition for gay badinage that, well
aimed, gave them great content.&nbsp; In school, the game was
played furtively.&nbsp; A slip of paper would be passed along the
forms of the fourth standard class bearing the inquiry of a
seeker after knowledge, &ldquo;Who pinched the cornet?&rdquo;
this would be varied by rough sketches executed by Master Nutler
of a lad running, with the words underneath, &ldquo;Hold
him!&rdquo;&nbsp; When Bobbie strolled out of school at dinner
time there would come an affected cry of alarm, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
off again!&rdquo;&nbsp; Robert Lancaster took all of this with
stolidity and in a manner differing from that which he would have
exhibited a month previously.&nbsp; It seemed that the failure of
his expedition had tamed him; certainly his stay in the hospital
and at the convalescent home had given him reticence.&nbsp; He
applied himself to his lessons.&nbsp; After a few weeks the other
boys declined to be led any longer by Master Nutler, because
there seemed little sport in rallying a man who showed no signs
of annoyance, and Bobbie Lancaster presently
found&mdash;excepting for an occasional reminder&mdash;that the
Brenchley escapade had gone out of memory.&nbsp; Miss Nutler on
one of the rare occasions when they met, expressed her regret at
the consequences of their disagreement, hinting that, so far as
she was concerned, the past could be shut out from memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was my eldest brother put me up to it,&rdquo; said
Miss Nutler apologetically.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know what a one he
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; remarked Master Lancaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should never &rsquo;ave thought of it if it
hadn&rsquo;t been for him,&rdquo; declared Miss Nutler.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A better hearted girl than me you wouldn&rsquo;t find in a
day&rsquo;s march.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dessay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; went on the young person, waxing
enthusiastic, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too good-hearted for this
world.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a fool to meself.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s
why I gave way when he told me to pretend you&rsquo;d hurt
me.&nbsp; See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so long as you say there&rsquo;s no ill-will and so
long as you agree to forgive and forget, so to speak, why
there&rsquo;s no reason, as you remarked just now, why we
shouldn&rsquo;t be capital friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never said no such thing,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>
<p><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Miss Nutler
wonderingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Words to that effect, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&nbsp; Not words to that effect, neither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re back in the band, aren&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am back in the band.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the girls in our cottage rave about your cornet
playing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Straight?&rdquo;&nbsp; He could not help smiling at
this generous compliment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if I should tell a lie,&rdquo; said Miss
Nutler.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, they&rsquo;re always talking about
you.&nbsp; How you&rsquo;ve growed and how you&rsquo;ve improved
in your manner and&mdash;there!&nbsp; I tell you.&nbsp; I get
quite jealous sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What call have you to be jealous?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! oh, dear!&rdquo; said the young woman
self-reproachfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve been and let the
cat out of the bag.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s me all the world
over.&nbsp; I never meant you to see that I
was&mdash;hem&mdash;fond of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put all ideas of that out of your red young
crumpet,&rdquo; he advised steadily, &ldquo;as soon as ever you
like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there somebody else?&rdquo; asked Miss Nutler,
flushing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you ask the question&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she live &rsquo;ere at the Homes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does not live &rsquo;ere at the Homes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she did,&rdquo; said Miss Nutler fiercely,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d pay her out, the cat.&nbsp; And you&rsquo;re a
double-faced boy, you are.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t be seen talking
to you for fifty thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guessed that was the amount.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Nutler walked off aflame with annoyance, turning as she
reached the gate and making a face not pretty, in order that
Bobbie might understand the true state of her feelings.&nbsp;
That evening one of the Nutler family handed Bobbie a note on
which was written, &ldquo;Dear sir, referring to our meeting, I
beg to inform you that all is over between us.&nbsp; Yours
obed&rsquo;tly, Louisa Nutler.&mdash;P.S.&nbsp; A reply by bearer
will oblige.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bobbie tore the note into many pieces,
threw them over the messenger, and going indoors penned a careful
note to Mrs. Bell, of Pimlico Walk.&nbsp; This contained an
account of his progress; contained also five words, &ldquo;Give
my love to Trixie,&rdquo; which note, reaching the Walk the next
morning, made so much sunshine for the industrious young lady
that she proceeded to scrub the stairs from top to basement in
order to prevent herself from becoming light-headed.</p>
<p>There was indeed progress to report.&nbsp; The Fourth Standard
being carried by assault, his brain had now to wrestle in the
large schoolroom with dogged enemies of youth.</p>
<p>By the help of an assistant master, whose stock of enthusiasm
had not been quite exhausted by lads of the Nutler brand, Bobbie
showed excellent fight, and if it sometimes happened that he was
worsted, the defeats were but temporary.&nbsp; Winter came, and
with it football matches.&nbsp; An eminent three-quarter (who was
also a trombone) having retired from the team during the off
season in order to take up duties at Kneller Hall, Bobbie, in
games with private schools, found himself selected for the
position.&nbsp; The drill-sergeant took interest in the lad, and
on the boarded-over swimming-bath, instructed him carefully at
five o&rsquo;clock each evening in the art of vaulting.&nbsp; All
this helped to make a solid youth of Robert Lancaster, and he
found himself wishful for manhood.</p>
<p>The Sister at the infirmary beyond the western gates, having
to take a <a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>month&rsquo;s holiday, a friend of hers came to act as
substitute, and this friend proving to be Sister Margaret, Bobbie
found an additional incentive for correct behaviour because
Sister Margaret, when going down at any time the broad gravelled
road between the cottages, always selected him for one of her
cheerful bows, causing Bobbie&rsquo;s cap to fly off in
acknowledgment and making him flush with gratification.&nbsp;
Sister Margaret told him that Myddleton West had gone to Ireland
for one of the daily journals, and together they read his letters
in that journal.&nbsp; It seemed clear that Sister Margaret
continued to have no objection to talking about Myddleton West,
for she made the boy describe several times over the morning when
he had called at his rooms in Fetter Lane; at each repetition
Bobbie managed to find (or to invent) some additional incident
that made the young woman&rsquo;s bright eyes become brighter
with interest.&nbsp; When the regular Sister returned, Sister
Margaret had to leave, and Bobbie walked with her to the station
to carry her portmanteau, giving much good advice on the way with
view of doing a good turn for his friend.&nbsp; Apparently his
arguments made some impression on Sister Margaret, for when, as
the train went off, he shouted, &ldquo;Give my kind respects to
him, Miss, when you write.&nbsp; And tell him he ain&rsquo;t
forgotten,&rdquo; it looked as though the young woman&rsquo;s
bright eyes became suddenly wet.</p>
<p>The seasons passed.&nbsp; The fourteenth birthday came so near
that it was quite possible to reckon the interval by number of
days.&nbsp; For some months Robert Lancaster had been a
half-timer; he desired now to say good-bye definitely to school,
and to go into the workshops, because this would be a conspicuous
milestone marking his journey.&nbsp; The Coastguard and the
Coastguard&rsquo;s daughter, and the long Customs&rsquo; officer
came to see him on one of the later days, and he showed them with
pride the tailor&rsquo;s shop, the bootmaker&rsquo;s shop, the
carpenter&rsquo;s shop, and the engineer&rsquo;s shop, and
Coastguard and himself (whilst the tall daughter went with the
representative of her Majesty&rsquo;s Customs to take tea at the
hotel opposite the gates) talked over questions of trades, and
their various advantages.&nbsp; They weighed them separately;
when the young couple returned, Coastguard with a look of wisdom
that judges of Appeal try to assume and cannot, delivered his
decision.&nbsp; Bobbie, interested in this, saw the long
Customs&rsquo; officer snatch a kiss from Coastguard&rsquo;s
daughter with no feeling of jealousy, and, indeed, with
diversion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing like helping yourself,&rdquo; remarked Bobbie,
amused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do give over, John,&rdquo; said Coastguard&rsquo;s
daughter reprovingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You never know when to
stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These youngsters,&rdquo; said Bobbie to Coastguard
paternally, &ldquo;they will carry on, won&rsquo;t they?&nbsp;
Same now as it was in our young day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dang the boy&rsquo;s eyes,&rdquo; said Coastguard,
&ldquo;if he don&rsquo;t notice everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes anyone,&rdquo; said Bobbie, &ldquo;when you
see a couple young enough to know better a kissin&rsquo; each
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re supposed not to notice such things at your
age,&rdquo; said the angel reprovingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the boy, acutely, &ldquo;supposed
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon you&rsquo;ll be the next one we shall hear of
getting engaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many a true word spoke in jest,&rdquo; said the
boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you think,&rdquo; turning with seriousness
to the Coastguard, &ldquo;you think I can&rsquo;t do better than
go in for learning that?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>&ldquo;Sure of it, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therefore to the engineer&rsquo;s shop went Bobbie, because
the Coastguard had pointed out to him that some of the knowledge
to be gained there could not fail some day to be valuable.&nbsp;
Not that he intended to become an engineer.&nbsp; Decision as to
his first occupation on leaving the Home had already been taken,
being preserved as a secret which he proposed not to disclose
until the appropriate moment came.&nbsp; At the tables in the
engineer&rsquo;s shop he worked, and learned under direction,
after some failures, how to use a lathe without pinching his
fingers.&nbsp; The lads worked in extra garments of aprons and
paper caps; their task made them so grimy that they felt sure no
one could tell them from adults; the wash that came after a day
in the workshop seemed to put them back ten years.&nbsp; An
increased feeling of maturity came to Bobbie when, on being
selected to play &ldquo;The Lost Chord,&rdquo; as a cornet solo
at a concert in the neighbourhood which the Home&rsquo;s band
attended, a local paper called him by a fascinating misprint
Mister Robert Lancaster, intending to say Master, but allowing
the i&rsquo;s to have it.&nbsp; He walked rigidly upright for
several weeks after this and spoke to no boy under the age of
thirteen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fancy yourself,&rdquo; remarked sarcastically the
boys whom he ignored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; he replied, frankly.</p>
<p>It became his keen endeavour at this period to reach at least
four feet six in height.&nbsp; He had special reasons for this
ambition, and days occurred when, in his impatience, he measured
himself three times during the twenty-four hours.&nbsp; The last
inch seemed as though it would never arrive; other lads in the
engineer&rsquo;s shop, to encourage him, expressed the cheerful
opinion that he had stopped growing.&nbsp; Finding in a newspaper
an advertisement specially addressed &ldquo;To the Short,&rdquo;
he wrote privately to Trixie Bell to obtain for him the golden
remedy that the advertisers promised to send on receipt of two
shillings and ninepence, and when Trixie, glad of an opportunity
for being useful, obeyed, sending him the result as a birthday
present, &ldquo;With kind regards,&rdquo; Bobbie found that the
remedy was but a pair of thick list soles to be worn inside the
boots; he perceived hopelessly that nothing could be done to
encourage Nature.&nbsp; The last pencil mark on the wall of his
dormitory denoting his height remained as a record for months;
depression enveloped him when he gazed at it.&nbsp; But there
came a spring season when he found to his intense delight that he
had, within a brief period, not only shot up to the necessary
inches, but just beyond them, and the mother of Collingwood
Cottage had to lengthen the arms of his jackets and the legs of
his trousers.&nbsp; On being measured anew in the tailor&rsquo;s
shop, he laughed with sheer delight.</p>
<p>The day of all days came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father wants to see you, Lancaster,&rdquo; announced
one of the other lads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Committee day,&rdquo; said the other lad.</p>
<p>Robert Lancaster ran off to find the Collingwood father, and
came up to him breathless.&nbsp; The Collingwood father was a
serious man, made more serious by his family of other
people&rsquo;s children; his face took now an aspect of
importance, and he laid his hand on the lad&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time&rsquo;s come,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>&ldquo;Three cheers,&rdquo; said Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep cool, my lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am cool,&rdquo; said Bobbie, trembling with
eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that the gentlemen, what you are
going now to have an interview with, represent so to speak your
benefactors what have looked after you and clothed you and fed
you and generally speaking kept you flourishing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go before the Committee,&rdquo; said the
father of Collingwood Cottage, solemnly, &ldquo;and what I want
to impress upon you, my boy, is the necessity of putting on your
very best manners.&nbsp; A little bad behaviour on your part will
go a long way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll watch out, father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be too civil,&rdquo; urged the father
of Collingwood, anxiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;I tell you that, Bobbie,
because, naturally, you ain&rsquo;t what I call the humblest chap
going, and if you want these nobs to agree to what you want, you
must show &rsquo;em any amount of what I may venture to call
deference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lick all the bloomin&rsquo; blackin&rsquo;
off their bloomin&rsquo; boots,&rdquo; promised Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give your &rsquo;ands another wash,&rdquo; recommended
the father, &ldquo;and then go up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Superintendent stood at the side of the table; seated
there were half-a-dozen men who looked like, and indeed were,
retired tradesmen.&nbsp; In one of them the lad recognized the
carpenter (now in white waistcoat and with other signs of
prosperity) who had been on the jury which had investigated,
years ago, the death of his mother.&nbsp; A cheery red-faced man
sat in the large arm-chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robert Lancaster, gentlemen, fourteen years of age and
a good lad with a fairly good record, has passed the Fourth
Standard, and is one of the best of our bandsmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, my lad!&rdquo;&nbsp; The jovial-looking chairman
pointed the ruler at him.&nbsp; &ldquo;What would you like to
be?&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve fed you and educated you and brought you
up, and we don&rsquo;t want to see all the trouble
wasted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moreover,&rdquo; said the carpenter, as Bobbie prepared
to speak, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a question on which, by rights, you
ought to take our advice.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re men of the world, and
as such we know what&rsquo;s good for you a jolly sight better
than you do.&nbsp; My argument has always been that pauper
children&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chairman coughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or whatever you like to call &rsquo;em ought not to be
allowed to pick and choose.&nbsp; It pampers &rsquo;em,&rdquo;
said the carpenter, gloomily, sending his penholder, nib
downwards, into the table, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you
say; it pampers &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like, sir, please,&rdquo; said Bobbie,
&ldquo;to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Choose a honest trade,&rdquo; suggested the
carpenter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the boy speak,&rdquo; urged one of the other
members.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to be a sailor,&rdquo; said the lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the carpenter, triumphantly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our band boys don&rsquo;t often go into the
navy,&rdquo; said the Superintendent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Most of them
go in for the other branch of the service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jolly good thing,&rdquo; said the gloomy carpenter,
with his fingers in the <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>pockets of his white waistcoat,
&ldquo;if all your armies and all your navies was done away with
and abolished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk sense!&rdquo; advised his neighbour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they,&rdquo; asked the carpenter, &ldquo;but a
tax on the respectable tradesmen of this country?&nbsp; What good
are they?&nbsp; What do they do?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I want
to know.&rdquo;&nbsp; He looked round at his colleagues with the
confident air of one propounding a riddle of which none knew the
answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will someone kindly tell me what good the
navy does?&nbsp; What benefit does it do me or any of us seated
at this table?&nbsp; If all our ships was to disappear this very
morning before twelve o&rsquo;clock struck, should I be any the
worse off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you silly old silly,&rdquo; broke in the lad on
the other side of the table, impetuously, &ldquo;if that was to
&rsquo;appen some foreign power would be down on us before you
could wink, and you&rsquo;d find yourself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; ordered the Superintendent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find yourself,&rdquo; persisted Bobbie, &ldquo;turned
into a bloomin&rsquo; Russian very like, and sent to
Siberia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have your answer,&rdquo; remarked the chairman,
jovially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kids&rsquo; talk,&rdquo; growled the carpenter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; declared Bobbie, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the only
protection you&rsquo;ve got to enable you to carry on your
business peaceably and successfully, and without
interference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never felt the want of no navy in carryin&rsquo; on
my business in Shoreditch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Bobbie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But if there hadn&rsquo;t been a navy you
would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was all very irregular; the Superintendent felt this, but
the members of the committee showed so much gratification in
seeing their colleague routed that it scarce seemed right for him
to interfere.&nbsp; The chairman rapped gently on the table as a
mild reminder that order appeared to be temporarily absent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fact of it is,&rdquo; said the carpenter, resentfully,
&ldquo;you youngsters get so pampered&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; said the chairman, &ldquo;let us get
along.&nbsp; You think you&rsquo;ll like the navy, my
lad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure of it, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hard life, mind you.&nbsp; Especially at
first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t mind that, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll undergo pretty severe preparation; we
shall have to find out from the doctor whether you can stand it
or not.&nbsp; Her Majesty doesn&rsquo;t want half and half sort
of lads in her navy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I shall be all right, sir.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
improved wonderful in the years I&rsquo;ve been here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Made a man of you, have we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have that, sir,&rdquo; said Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something was said,&rdquo; interrupted the carpenter,
still smarting, &ldquo;about this lad having a fairly good
record.&nbsp; I should like to be kindly informed what his record
actually is.&nbsp; If there&rsquo;s anything against him
it&rsquo;s only right and fair and honest and just that we should
know about it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Superintendent explained, and Robert Lancaster went white
at the <a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>lips as he heard the account&mdash;by no means a harsh
account&mdash;of his escape from the Homes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since which time,&rdquo; added the Superintendent,
&ldquo;his conduct has been most exemplary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; burst out the lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is the lad,&rdquo; argued the carpenter,
&ldquo;that you&rsquo;re going to spend more of the
ratepayers&rsquo; money on.&nbsp; This is the lad that&rsquo;s
cost us a matter of thirty pound a year for the last four years,
and now we&rsquo;re going to send him off to a training ship,
where he&rsquo;ll cost us a matter of thirty-two pound a
year.&nbsp; Is that so, or is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; said the chairman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; declared the retired
carpenter, gloomily, &ldquo;to make a man give up public life
altogether.&nbsp; What was he when we begun to have to do with
him?&nbsp; Answer me, somebody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Superintendent asked if the information was really
necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, sir,&rdquo; said Robert Lancaster, from the
other side of the table.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can give the information
what&rsquo;s required.&nbsp; I was left without parents, I was,
and I become the &rsquo;sociate of bad characters.&nbsp; My
coming down &rsquo;ere put me on the straight, and I tell you I
ain&rsquo;t particular anxious to get off of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lad!&rdquo; said the jovial chairman,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll see that you don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll
have a couple of years on the training ship, and when you leave
there I hope you&rsquo;ll make up your mind to be a credit to
your parish, to your country, and your Queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; said Robert Lancaster, softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we shall look to you to see that all this money
which has been spent on you is not wasted.&nbsp; We shall expect
you to become a good citizen, one who will help in some small way
to improve the estimate in which his great country is
held.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said the carpenter.&nbsp; But the other
members of the committee said, &ldquo;Hear, hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back and see the Homes when you get an
opportunity,&rdquo; said the jovial chairman, a little moved by
his own eloquence; &ldquo;remember that we shall watch your
career with interest and&mdash;God bless you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chairman leaned across the table and shook hands with
Robert.&nbsp; The lad bowed awkwardly to the other members of the
committee, and would have spoken, but something in his throat
prevented him.&nbsp; He punched at his cap, and on a signal from
the Superintendent went out at the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pampering of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said the retired
carpenter, darkly, &ldquo;pampering of &rsquo;em as fast as ever
you can.&rdquo;</p>

97</span>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> vessel to which Bobbie went had
been in its gallant youth a battleship and possessed an eventful
and a creditable record.&nbsp; Moored in the Thames off the flat
coast of Essex, and painted black, it was a huge, solid,
responsible three-decker, doing excellent work in the autumn of
its life, and giving temporary residence to some five or six
hundred boys.&nbsp; Mainly, the youngsters were metropolitan, but
sometimes the guardians of distant towns in the North would
arrange with the Board for one of their lads to be consigned to
the training ship, who, being arrived, spoke a language that
seemed to the London boys almost foreign.&nbsp; A long, low jetty
ran from the shore as far as it dared into the water; where it
stopped, a gig rowed by eight of the boys, under the command of
an officer, took you off to the big black ship, on the starboard
side of which a dozen small boats rocked and nudged each other in
the ribs, and a barge dozed stolidly.&nbsp; (In case of alarm the
whole of the boys could be cleared out of the ship and carried
away by these to safety.)&nbsp; Away down the river a smart
brigantine berthed generally in view, and this the boys who
intended to join the Royal Navy gazed at hopefully, because it
was the brigantine which taught them seamanship, with assistance
from a master mariner and two mates; it was the brigantine, too,
which now and again skimmed the cream of the <i>Westmouth</i> in
the shape of some forty boys whom it conveyed out of the river
into the open, and presently down Channel to one of the training
vessels which acted as the last refining process before entrance
was made into the service.&nbsp; To the Essex shore came, nearly
every week, from various poor-law schools, boys who, after
inspection, were conveyed out to the <i>Westmouth</i>, where the
captain looked at the doctor&rsquo;s report, giving their
heights, chest measurements, and other particulars forming the
foundation of their dossier.&nbsp; This over, the new boys went
back to shore to be clothed in sailor uniform, and re-appeared in
blue serge trousers and jacket and cap, trying to look as though
the navy had for them no secrets, and the <i>Westmouth</i>
nothing in the way of information to impart.&nbsp; They came in
and went out of the training vessel at the rate of about three
hundred year, so that the numbered white cases down on the lower
deck containing kits were always in use, and every hammock on the
three decks contained at night a tired-out lad.</p>
<p><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>For
Robert Lancaster soon discovered that the note of the
<i>Westmouth</i> was to keep moving.&nbsp; If you worked, you
worked hard; if you played, you played hard.&nbsp; School had no
great demands upon him now, for being out of the Fourth Standard,
it was required of him that he should attend but two hours on the
Friday of every week; a boy might have assumed that with this
dispensation one could look forward to a life of ease and
content.&nbsp; Not so on board the <i>Westmouth</i>.&nbsp; Robert
Lancaster was never allowed to be lazy.&nbsp; The life formed an
exact opposite to those old days at Hoxton (several centuries ago
it seemed to him), when the delight of life was to
&ldquo;mouch,&rdquo; which, translated, is to wander through the
years aimlessly.&nbsp; Robert made some vague suggestions of
reform to his comrades, with the result that a boy from Poplar
made up his mind to state a complaint formally on the first
opportunity.&nbsp; The Poplar boy (numbered 290) had already
written a brief account, which he had shown to Robert, entitled
&ldquo;The Mutiny on the <i>Westmouth</i>,&rdquo; a forecast of a
somewhat bloodthirsty character, where gore flowed readily, and
exclamations of a melodramatic character were used, such as
&ldquo;Die, you dog!&rdquo; and &ldquo;At last we meet face to
face!&rdquo; but Robert criticized this with some acidity,
because in the course of it Number Two Ninety himself performed
all the deeds of surpassing valour, using six Martini-Henry
rifles and a field gun, at the same time doing desperate action
with two cutlasses: the end of the account gave a gruesome
description of the upper deck strewn with the bodies of officers,
and of Number Two Ninety-being unanimously elected captain by his
fellow mutineers.&nbsp; Robert said he thought the picture
overdrawn.&nbsp; Opportunity, however, occurred on some of the
guardians from Poplar visiting the ship; one, a sharp clergyman,
demanded to know of the Poplar boys whether they had any
complaint to make.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; sang most of the Poplar boys.&nbsp; The
mutineer&rsquo;s arm went up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the clergyman gratified.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a lad now who has something to
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Step forward, Two Ninety,&rdquo; ordered the old
captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell this gentleman what it is you wish to
complain of.&nbsp; Is it the food?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grub&rsquo;s all right, sir,&rdquo; growled the Poplar
boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it the uniform?&rdquo; asked the sharp
clergyman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fault to find with the clothes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it the ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ship&rsquo;s good enough, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert Lancaster, passing with a pail, half stopped to hear
what the Poplar boy would say under this process of
exhaustion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, what is the complaint you wish to
make?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two Ninety from Poplar twisted his sailor&rsquo;s cap
nervously, and looked with some interest at his shoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; he burst out, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s like
this.&nbsp; They always keep on making you keep on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert Lancaster, finding after a few weeks that his
disinclination to continuous work and exercise had vanished,
detached himself therefore from the small set on the
<i>Westmouth</i>, called &ldquo;The Born-Tireds.&rdquo;&nbsp;
After the fifth week privileges came to him; he was allowed to go
ashore with <a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>the other boys on Sunday afternoon; he joined in the
drill, and this he liked so much that he concealed from the
officers the fact that the cornet and he were close
acquaintances, fearing that membership of the band, which
practised far away down in the hold, would interfere.&nbsp; He
found books in the library with a sea flavour, and read Stevenson
and Henty, and Clark Russell.&nbsp; He liked Clark
Russell&rsquo;s books, because they had always one admirable
young lady in a distressful predicament, and this young lady he
always thought of as being Trixie Bell&mdash;Trixie who had sent
him her photograph, taken by an eminent artist of Hackney Road,
and presenting her as in a snowstorm, with no hat, a basket of
choice roses on her arm.&nbsp; At prayers one night, Robert found
himself, somewhat to his surprise, introducing a special silent
reference to Trixie, and, pleased with his daring originality, he
continued it, feeling in a shy, half-ashamed way, that he had now
assumed a responsible position in regard to the young lady.&nbsp;
For the rest, there was not much time on the <i>Westmouth</i> to
think of outside affairs.</p>
<p>He found his average day made up in this manner.&nbsp; At six
o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the lower deck, where he and some
three hundred other boys slept, became suddenly filled with the
blaring of a bugle; on the instant Robert slipped out of his
hammock.&nbsp; The chief petty officers (important lads of about
fifteen or sixteen) issued orders, the boys dressed swiftly,
hammocks were rolled up and stowed away at the sides, and then
the busy working day began.&nbsp; Robert Lancaster, despatched
with other gallant sailors of his division, scrubbed the upper
deck (protected by a canvas awning in summer, and an awning and
curtains in winter), the while two divisions saw to the main
deck.&nbsp; Then the upper deck had to be swabbed, under the
superintendence of the ship&rsquo;s officers, and, this done,
breakfast-time had arrived.&nbsp; Robert Lancaster always felt
the better for his breakfast, being, indeed, of the growing age
when appetite is nearly ever acute and demanding to be
satisfied.&nbsp; The watch on the mess deck cleared away, and at
half-past eight one bell sounded.&nbsp; At nine o&rsquo;clock two
bells sounded, with the singers&rsquo; call for prayers and also
for punishments, at which hour a few boys with correction looming
close to them, wished that they had chosen the life of a
landsman.&nbsp; The excellent old captain&rsquo;s theory was that
you should either pat a boy on the back or cane him on the back,
and this system worked out very well in practice; the most severe
punishment consisted of a few hours&rsquo; solitude in the dark
cell at the foc&rsquo;sle end of the ship&mdash;an extreme remedy
resorted to but once or twice a year.&nbsp; Prayers and
punishment being over, there occurred work again.&nbsp;
Sail-making, painting the sides of the <i>Westmouth</i>,
seamanship instruction; in the tailors&rsquo; shop, manufacture
of flags, repairing of oilskins and sou&rsquo;westers,
lengthening of trousers for their growing owners, making of
seamanship stripes, re-covering of life-belts; the biggest boys
in the Rigger&rsquo;s class called upon to strip and serve afresh
the lower rigging of the ship.&nbsp; Relaxation came to Robert
when sent out with others in one of the small boats which
clustered at the side of the <i>Westmouth</i>, on which occasions
he learnt the arts of boat-pulling and boat-sailing, under the
guidance of a giant-voiced officer, who roared advice and frank
criticism.&nbsp; Signalling had to be learnt, and this demanded
of Robert that his intelligence should be livened; the lad being
on his mettle, and having made up <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>his mind to extort the secrets from
this cryptic procedure, earned commendation.&nbsp; There were
classes in gunnery, too, where knowledge was gained in using the
rifle and cutlass, as well as the management of field guns; the
rifles full-sized, and, indeed, a little out of proportion to the
height of the smaller boys, so that it sometimes seemed that it
would have been easier for the Martini-Henry to manage the boy
than for the boy to manage the Martini-Henry.&nbsp; And about
mid-day, after half an hour&rsquo;s rest, when Robert bowled boys
out on the upper deck, or being at the wickets set in a wooden
socket, sent the ball flying away to the Essex shore, came
dinner.&nbsp; Now dinner on the <i>Westmouth</i>, mind you, was
dinner.</p>
<p>A bugle call brought the boys scurrying down the broad
hatchway on to the mess deck, where a harmonium had been placed
in position, and, as they hurried down, adjusting their red
handkerchiefs bib-fashion, the cook&rsquo;s assistants dragged
young lorries around by the long wooden tables, one waggon loaded
with roast beef, another waggon carrying potatoes, another
bearing vegetables and another bread.&nbsp; The boys on sharp
days when appetite had become keen found it difficult to sing the
grace to which the harmonium played a prelude, because their
mouths watered.&nbsp; The scent from the roast beef was to them
the most entrancing perfume, and ranged in companies they could
not prevent their eyes from wandering to their table where
portions were being served out in the deep tin plates.&nbsp; A
bugle call&mdash;everything on board the <i>Westmouth</i> was
done by bugle calls; and none was so effective as the call for
silence&mdash;and grace.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Be present at our table, Lord,<br />
Be &rsquo;ere and everywhere adored;<br />
These creatures bless, and grant that we<br />
May feast in Paradise with Thee.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On ordinary days, work re-commenced in the afternoon with
occasional brief rests for play, and after tea if there still
remained work to do it had to be done.&nbsp; Strict orders had to
be observed in the way of behaviour, and Robert slipped into
these with greater ease because of his experience in the Cottage
Homes.&nbsp; He learnt that an order being given, obedience had
to follow instantly and without question; the saluting of the
officers was, he knew, but a respectful sign of his willingness
to comply with this rule.&nbsp; In this way Robert Lancaster
learnt discipline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy enough,&rdquo; argued Robert to the
Poplar boy when he had been on the ship for nearly a year and was
looking forward to the position of Chief Petty Officer with three
stripes on his arm and a salary of penny a week, &ldquo;once you
get into the swing of it.&nbsp; If you do have to put up with a
bit of rough, you&rsquo;ve always got your Wednesdays to look
forward to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wednesday, indeed, represented the golden day of the week for
the <i>Westmouth</i>.&nbsp; Friends came then on permission of
the Captain, and when one evening a letter from Trixie Bell was
brought over to the ship by the post boy, a letter which asked
her dear Robert to obtain a permit for two, <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>the lad
procured this and sent it off with bashful anticipation of seeing
the young lady and her large mother.&nbsp; The afternoon came,
and he watched each arrival of the gig from the shore for the
first sight of Trixie; wondering amusedly how Mrs. Bell would
endure the brief passage and how she would be hauled out of the
boat.&nbsp; But Trixie did not arrive nor did her mother come to
endanger the safety of the gig; instead Number Three Thirty-Three
(who was Robert) found himself called to receive a mite of a
woman in a sailor hat bearing the inscription H.M.S.
<i>Magnificent</i> in large gold letters, who having come up the
ladder at the side of the ship one step at a time, now stood with
a net full of oranges and cakes beside her; her hands at her
waist as though doubtful whether she ought not to dance a
hornpipe, and looking up at Robert with her bead-like eyes full
of astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; cried little Miss Threepenny, &ldquo;if he
hasn&rsquo;t grown up to be a reg&rsquo;lar what&rsquo;s a
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was expecting two others,&rdquo; remarked Robert,
bending shyly to shake hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t come and they sent me
instead,&rdquo; said the little woman, mopping her forehead with
her handkerchief.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor Mrs. Bell is as bad as bad,
and Trixie&mdash;bless her &rsquo;eart&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t think
of leaving her.&nbsp; So I says, &lsquo;Sposin&rsquo; I
go?&rsquo;&nbsp; And Trixie says, &lsquo;You, Miss
Threepenny?&rsquo; and I says, &lsquo;Yes, me.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
my annual &rsquo;oliday from Tabernacle Street Wednesday next,
and&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; says Trixie,&rdquo; went on the
small woman, declining to anticipate the end of her story,
&ldquo;&lsquo;you&rsquo;ll go and get lost.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I
says, &lsquo;Stuff and nonsense; if a grown-up woman of forty
can&rsquo;t take care of herself, who can?&nbsp; Besides,&rsquo;
I says, &lsquo;I want to see the dear boy.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
Trixie says, &lsquo;So did I.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she said that, did she?&rdquo; remarked Robert
gratified.&nbsp; Other boys crowded round, preparing to invent
humorous badinage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Miss Threepenny acutely, &ldquo;and
what&rsquo;s more, she meant it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It required some courage for a boy of Robert&rsquo;s age to
escort the amazing little woman over the ship; urgent whispers
from the other lads to be introduced to the new missis did not
assist him.&nbsp; The Chief Officer nodded approvingly, and this
gave encouragement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Booking clerk at Fenchurch Street,&rdquo; chattered on
the little woman, &ldquo;gave me &rsquo;alf a ticket, and I gave
him a bit of my mind.&nbsp; People think because I ain&rsquo;t so
tall as I might be that I &rsquo;aren&rsquo;t got a tongue in me
&rsquo;ead.&nbsp; They find out their mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Mrs. Bell very ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t much longer for this world,&rdquo;
answered Miss Threepenny.&nbsp; &ldquo;She may linger on for a
year or two, but that good young gel of hers will be left all
alone in the world before she&rsquo;s very much older.&nbsp;
Fortunately she&rsquo;s got a wise &rsquo;ead on young shoulders
and&mdash;What low ceilings they are &rsquo;ere.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
little woman bent her small body from an entirely unfounded fear
of touching the roof with her sailor hat.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this part of the ship called,
Bobbie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; explained the lad, &ldquo;is called the
foc&rsquo;sle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;&lsquo;why&rsquo;
is the one word you mustn&rsquo;t use on board ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Miss Threepenny trotted round, breathless with the
endeavour to keep up with the lad&rsquo;s stride, presently
thanking her stars in earnest terms when, the hour being two, she
was allowed to sit on the foc&rsquo;sle steps of the upper deck
in company with a few mothers and sisters to watch the
afternoon&rsquo;s entertainment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall &rsquo;ave to take notice of everything,&rdquo;
she chirruped, &ldquo;and go through it all when I get back to
Pimlico Walk.&nbsp; Trixie will want to &rsquo;ear about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go and get frightened,&rdquo; urged
Robert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me frightened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be some desperate deeds performed during
the next hour,&rdquo; said Robert importantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long as there&rsquo;s no firing of guns,&rdquo; said
the little woman, adjusting her skirts precisely, &ldquo;I
shan&rsquo;t so much as wink.&nbsp; Once they begin to bang
away&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two of the women visitors who had been looking curiously at
the small creature, hastened to remark with the knowledge born of
experience that there would be firing, one adding that for her
part she always shut her eyes and put her hands over her ears
when it came to that part; an ingenious plan which happy Miss
Threepenny promised to adopt.&nbsp; Robert ran off and
disappeared.</p>
<p>The alarming clang, clang, clang of a bell!&nbsp; Upon the
instant, a swift rushing to and fro; a throwing open of the door
leading to the captain&rsquo;s room; boys with buckets of water
hurrying up and forming in line; more boys dragging long boa
constrictors of leathern hose up to the doorway; still more boys
ready with brass nozzles to fix on; more boys again in a
tremendous state of excitement bearing scarlet extincteurs on
their backs; a white-capped, white-aproned cook up from below and
assisting; sharp commands from the officers; the old captain
watching all with his watch open.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; says
the captain of the <i>Westmouth</i> presently, &ldquo;very good
indeed.&nbsp; Who was the first bucket up, Mr.
Waltham?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Number Three Fifty-Two, sir,&rdquo;
says the chief officer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Three Fifty-Two,&rdquo;
thereupon says the captain, &ldquo;catch this
sixpence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Band now at a corner of the upper deck, with a stout drum
placed upon trestles, to be whacked presently as though it had
committed some gross breach of discipline.&nbsp; Music-stands up;
brass instruments tested; the bandmaster taps his wooden stand
sharply.&nbsp; Three hundred boys in detachments on either side
of the deck; first officer, with a voice accustomed to open-air
speaking, with the captain on the poop.&nbsp; A brief drill, and
then,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Form divisions!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right about face!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;March!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The band plays; the two broad, close, moving detachments go
steadily around.&nbsp; A roar from the chief officer, and at once
the broad masses become a number of thin strands with a
serpentine movement to a new and more cheerful march from the
band, and doing it with absolute accuracy for several
minutes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo;&nbsp; Music stops.</p>
<p><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; shouts the old captain from the
poop, &ldquo;very fair, very fair indeed!&nbsp; Eh, Mr.
Waltham?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very fair indeed, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A selection made from the crowd; the rest jump up on the sides
of the ship, and become an audience.&nbsp; The selected boys
stiffly in line, jackets off, accept from a chief petty officer
with a sack, pairs of wooden dumb-bells.&nbsp; Order given, they
face round, watching the instructor narrowly and with
seriousness.&nbsp; A signal from him and band having started a
gentle waltz, the two hundred sailor boys go through a movement
of thrusting the arms forward, withdrawing them sharply, keeping
time ever to the music.&nbsp; A change of air on the part of the
band, and each pair of arms swings from side to side.&nbsp;
Another, and with clockwork preciseness the bells are up high,
return to touch breast, go down to toes.&nbsp; A whole dozen of
these changes, and amongst the later ones, movements with
definite stamp of the right foot on the deck to the music of a
Scotch reel.&nbsp; Pantomime rally from the band; a bugle call,
and the deck is clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t seen it,&rdquo; says astounded little
Miss Threepenny to her two neighbours, and standing now on the
topmost stair of the foc&rsquo;sle steps, &ldquo;I should never
&rsquo;ave believed it true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; remarks one of the women,
lightly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You watch out now, Miss.&nbsp; My
Jimmy&rsquo;s in the next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To a march from the obliging band, enter forty serious boys,
brown-legginged, belted, and bearing rifles.&nbsp; At the words
of command, these go through a number of offensive and defensive
movements, forming squares, performing cutlass drill, making
lunges with their bayonetted rifles at a supposititious enemy;
killing this supposititious enemy and withdrawing the bayonet
neatly from his lifeless body.&nbsp; A good quarter of an hour of
hard drill this, for which they are more than repaid by applause
from the younger boys seated on the sides of the vessel, and a
word of approval from the captain:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere comes Bobbie,&rdquo; cries Miss Threepenny,
excitedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, dear! oh, dear! what will they be up
to next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mothers seated on the steps may well start and clutch each
other&rsquo;s arms, for field guns are being dragged on now by
straw-hatted detachments, and, to a brisk air from the band,
tugged by long ropes around and around the deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is,&rdquo; cries Miss Threepenny,
excitedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;There he is again.&nbsp; And there he is
once more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No time for Robert to take notice of the little woman&rsquo;s
shrill comments, even if the bustle allowed him to hear, for
field guns are things that demand attention jealously.&nbsp; An
order pulls them up short; Robert with eight other lads stopping
their gun on the starboard side.&nbsp; Every boy panting; every
boy with his flushed face directed towards the chief officer on
the poop.&nbsp; A shrill whistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dismount!&rdquo; shouts the chief officer.</p>
<p>Fierce attack on the guns, wheels off, axles unpinned, guns
lifted, remainder of carriage pulled to pieces, all down flat on
the deck, boy seated on them and looking up at the poop for
comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen seconds, Mr. Waltham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen, sir,&rdquo; says the chief officer
respectfully; &ldquo;fifteen as near as a toucher.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>&ldquo;They did it in less time last week, Mr.
Waltham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did it in less time last week, sir,&rdquo; replies
the chief officer.</p>
<p>The old captain shakes his head first at the scarlet-faced
lads seated on the portions of their gun carriages and then at
his watch, as though inclined to blame the watch as much as the
boys.&nbsp; The instructor goes from one set of lads to another
growling a word of advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Re-mount!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every boy to his feet; the parts of the carriage seized;
wheels held in place and fixed; the heavy gun lifted and slung,
carriage pushed forward to catch it in position.&nbsp;
Robert&rsquo;s detachment, to their great annoyance and
confusion, find all their quick efforts retarded by the
clumsiness of Number Eight, who, having mistaken his duties, has
come into collision with another boy, and seems inclined to argue
the matter out and prove himself thoroughly in the wrong before
anything further is done.&nbsp; At least six seconds lost by this
action on the part of Number Eight in Robert Lancaster&rsquo;s
gun, so that the other five guns are all perfect and their boys
standing cool and serene, whilst the final struggle is being
concluded on the starboard side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather want that movement concluded to-day,&rdquo;
says the old captain, leaning over and speaking ironically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your number?&rdquo; asks the instructor of
the offending boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; remarks the instructor, &ldquo;it might as
well be nought.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t your place there?&nbsp; Very
well, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try that again, boys,&rdquo; cries the chief
officer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do it sharper this time.&nbsp; Think what
you&rsquo;re about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thought and celerity and earnestness are all brought to bear
on the next dismounting, and Number Eight of Robert&rsquo;s set,
reserving justification for his previous conduct, proves himself
as able a seaman as the rest.&nbsp; The remounting is performed
with similar swiftness, and the old captain lets the case of his
watch close with a snap and says, leaning over the rails again
and addressing the boys on deck, &ldquo;Very good, very good
indeed.&nbsp; Eh, Mr. Waltham?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Very good
indeed, sir,&rdquo; agrees the chief officer.</p>
<p>Fierce business coming now!&nbsp; The white-headed mops go
down the nozzles of the guns, come out again, the gunners stand
clear, one lad jerks a string, and&mdash;bang!&nbsp; White mop
down again head first and withdrawn, gun sighted, and
again&mdash;bang!&nbsp; It being unusual for an attacking force
to do this dangerous work without casualty, half a dozen boys
affect to receive the fire of the unseen enemy and fall on deck
screaming with great anguish, &ldquo;Oh, oh, oh!&rdquo; and
&ldquo;&rsquo;Elp, &rsquo;elp, &rsquo;elp!&rdquo; to the great
consternation of one mother up near the foc&rsquo;sle, who is
with difficulty restrained from rushing down the steps.&nbsp;
Ambulance corps hurries forward; one wounded boy has his trousers
pulled up, his bared leg set between two pieces of wood and tied
up, a stretcher brought, and he is taken, now giving agonizing
groans, which have a fine suggestion of pathos, to the port side
deck.&nbsp; Other boys who have fallen victims to the
non-existent enemy have their arms placed in slings or their
heads bandaged, and are led away by sympathetic ambulance
men.</p>
<p><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>&ldquo;Sound for the march past, bugler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Band, which has been interested in this scene of carnage,
snatches up its instruments and starts a cheerful, brisk,
trotting air; the boys take the ropes and tug the guns on the
field carriages once around the deck, the wounded following in
the rear and still giving realistic groans at every other step,
all disappearing at last through the large doors of the
foc&rsquo;sle to the applause of boys seated on the sides and
fluttering of handkerchiefs from the foc&rsquo;sle steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bray&rsquo;vo, Bobbie,&rdquo; cries little Miss
Threepenny.&nbsp; She turns and whispers apprehensively to the
two women.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re none of &rsquo;em reelly
&rsquo;urt, are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Urt?&rdquo; echoes one of the two women.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They know better than go and get &rsquo;urt, bless
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; says the little woman, &ldquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t join in it for forty thousand million
pound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rifle lads again, faces set determinedly, marching up the
deck with steady and definite stride.&nbsp; Four movements, and
they are down on one knee preparing to receive the enemy.&nbsp;
This time the enemy is no fictitious enemy, for the doors of the
foc&rsquo;sle being thrown open, out rush shrieking noisy
warriors who from their language and the fact that they are
carrying long poles instead of firearms are clearly negro
aborigines of the district, and these shout
&ldquo;Alla-bulla-wulla&rdquo; in a very desperate way, throwing
themselves on their opponents under the foolish impression that
something can be done to a solid square of British sailors.&nbsp;
A bugle call and the square rises, moves, and taking the
offensive, presses the mistaken aborigines back, but these still
cry &ldquo;Alla-bulla-walla&rdquo; (being apparently of a race
with limited conversational powers), and break up the detachment,
so that a hand-to-hand struggle ensues where every man carries
his life in peril, and every man remembers the country that gave
him birth.&nbsp; The British are pulled together again; they form
by command into two lines, these two lines stretching well across
the field of operations press the enemy slowly but determinedly
back.&nbsp; Changing its tactics the enemy now shout,
&ldquo;Wulla-bulla-alla,&rdquo; but even this reversal of the
original battle cry proves useless, and the final struggle is
stopped (because in point of fact, one or two sets are beginning
to fight in real earnest) by the bugle call to retreat.&nbsp;
Victory gained, the British sailors re-form, and singing exultant
music to&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A life on the ocean wave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A life on the stormy deep,<br />
Where the billowy waters wave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the stars their vigil keep,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>they march round and pass the saluting point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all bad,&rdquo; says the captain.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Eh, Mr. Waltham?&nbsp; Considering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all bad, sir,&rdquo; replies the chief officer,
&ldquo;considering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert escorted his little visitor down to tea, a few of his
intimate chums forming a circle around her in order to prevent
the incursion of mere curiosity.&nbsp; Miss Threepenny, finding
herself the object and centre of all this consideration,
chattered away over her tea and bread and butter, <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>telling the
circle a few of her best repartees, with many a &ldquo;Oh, I
says,&rdquo; and &ldquo;What! she says&rdquo;; each recital
finishing triumphantly with the sentence, &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s
all they get for trying to score off me.&rdquo;&nbsp; The small
woman being swung down to the lower deck, professed herself much
shocked at seeing the slung-up hammocks, declaring that eviction
from her model dwellings would ensue if this were known, and
covering her face with her tiny hands in a way that amused the
lads very much.&nbsp; Before leaving she ascertained the
whereabouts of Robert&rsquo;s locker, and finding the white box
with Robert&rsquo;s number painted atop, slipped inside an
envelope containing a silver coin of enormous proportions.&nbsp;
On the upper deck again, Robert Lancaster feeling it politic to
do everything possible in order to give Miss Threepenny
subject-matter for conversation on her return to Trixie, went up
to the foc&rsquo;sle rigging to the foretop and was down again
before she had time to beg of him to be careful, following this
up by acts of a similarly perilous nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How in the world I shall find breath enough to tell
&rsquo;em all about you,&rdquo; she said distractedly,
&ldquo;goodness only knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to mention,&rdquo; said Robert,
&ldquo;that I&rsquo;m going to be made a chief petty officer next
week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how long did you say it&rsquo;d be before you
left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t stay long,&rdquo; he said
importantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;They want chaps in the Royal Navy, and
I&rsquo;m five foot one already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They &rsquo;ave made a man of you, Bobbie,&rdquo;
declared the little woman, looking up at him admiringly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;d think to look at you now that it was only a
few years ago you was nothing more or less than&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just put your &rsquo;and on my arm,&rdquo; interrupted
Robert rather hastily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Above the elbow, I
mean.&nbsp; Now then!&rdquo;&nbsp; He drew his arm up slowly, and
the muscles stood out hard and rigid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re nothing more nor less,&rdquo; said Miss
Threepenny, &ldquo;than what they call in books a Herkools.&nbsp;
And&mdash;and you&rsquo;ve quite made up your mind to be a
sailor, Bobbie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Navy,&rdquo; said Bobbie
proudly.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the signal for you to be
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little woman having found her fishing net, now empty but
for the current number of &ldquo;The Upper Ten Novelette,&rdquo;
went carefully.&nbsp; Her sailor hat was slightly awry, and
detecting this by a casual glance at some polished brass, she
adjusted it, and pulled her cape straight.&nbsp; The circle of
defending boys conducted her to the side of the ship; saw her
safely down the slippery gangway ladder to the gig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t kiss you, me dear,&rdquo; she whispered
to Robert, &ldquo;because they&rsquo;d only guy you about it
afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give my love to &rsquo;em in Pimlico Walk,&rdquo; said
Robert shyly, as he lifted her into the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall keep some of it for meself,&rdquo; said the
little woman archly.&nbsp; She spoke to the officer at the stern
of the boat.&nbsp; &ldquo;Which side of the boat shall I sit,
mister?&rdquo;&nbsp; The officer replied that it could not
possibly matter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; she said
resignedly, &ldquo;if it overbalances don&rsquo;t blame me.&nbsp;
Goo&rsquo; bye, Bobbie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goo&rsquo; bye,&rdquo; cried Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be a good boy,&rdquo; called out the little woman in
the rocking gig.</p>
<p><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>&ldquo;A good what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good man, I mean,&rdquo; she shouted
apologetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget,&rdquo; cried the little woman,
putting one hand to the side of her mouth&mdash;&ldquo;oh, dear!
how this boat does bob about&mdash;don&rsquo;t forget that we
mean to be proud of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t forget,&rdquo; he promised.</p>
<p>And, indeed, Robert Lancaster kept this in his memory.</p>

108</span>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Life</span> on the <i>Westmouth</i> being
too exacting to permit one to count the hours, Robert Lancaster
came to the end of his training there with a sudden jerk that
almost astonished him.&nbsp; Fifty lads were taken off the books,
of whom he found himself to be one; some of them deciding for the
merchant service, were despatched to the Home at Limehouse for
that purpose; others, qualified in regard to measurement and
desires, only waited for the brigantine to arrive for their names
to be taken off the Watch Bill, and to resign their numbers to
other lads.&nbsp; The old captain, meeting Robert on the upper
deck, honoured him with five minutes&rsquo; conversation, giving
him a word of counsel, and directing him to give the old ship a
call whenever the chance to do so offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget, my lad, that now your opportunity
is coming to show us all that the trouble and money you have cost
have been well laid out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep yourself straight; be obedient to your officers,
remember that the Navy has a fine, a glorious reputation, which
you must help to keep up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Above all, be a credit to the <i>Westmouth</i>, and see
that we have good news of you.&nbsp; That will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon, sir.&nbsp; Any objection to my having a day in
London &rsquo;fore I join the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To visit friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; said the old captain with his
sharp air of courtesy.</p>
<p>See Robert Lancaster clearing his locker down on the lower
deck and distributing souvenirs to his colleagues; a part of the
inside of a watch to one; a copy of &ldquo;Kidnapped&rdquo; to
another; several pieces of rare old string to the boy from
Poplar, now, under the stress of <i>Westmouth</i> discipline, a
contented, optimistic lad.&nbsp; See Robert Lancaster going off
in the gig with six shillings tied in his handkerchief, being
part of the prize for swimming gained by him at the last
competition, and taking train at the small station for Fenchurch
Street.&nbsp; See him arriving near the old neighbourhood and
walking with a fine, sailor-like roll in his wide trousers and
open-necked jacket towards Pimlico Walk, in which thoroughfare,
now it seemed to <a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>him more preposterously narrow than ever, children
stopped the playing of tipcat to stare at him open-mouthed, and
women going into miniature shops arrested themselves in order to
ascertain, from feelings of vague curiosity, his destination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one about?&rdquo; he asked in the doorway of Mrs.
Bell&rsquo;s millinery establishment.&nbsp; The small window was
still set out with magnificent feathered hats, but there appeared
to be a suggestion of good taste in the arrangement that had in
the old days been absent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said a little girl sitting on a high chair
behind the counter, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who else d&rsquo;you want?&rdquo; asked the girl
cautiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Mrs. Bell about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been bedridden for the last six months, if
that&rsquo;s what you call being about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Trixie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean Miss Bell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Bell, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl stepped from the stool, and went to the foot of the
stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shawp!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; She returned at once to
the counter with a manner slightly less defensive.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She sits upstairs and reads to the old gel in the middle
of the day, and I&rsquo;m in charge down &rsquo;ere.&nbsp; When
she comes down I go up, see?&nbsp; It don&rsquo;t do to leave the
place without someone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a rustle on the lower stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bobbie!&rdquo;&nbsp; A delighted exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ullo, Trix,&rdquo; he said nervously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the world using you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Aven&rsquo;t you grown?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been at that game, too.&nbsp; I
s&rsquo;pose I was about the last person that was in your
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Trixie Bell, &ldquo;the very
last.&nbsp; Me and mother were just then talking about you
upstairs.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t your face brown, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours isn&rsquo;t brown,&rdquo; said Robert, with a
clumsy attempt at compliment, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s got every
other good quality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tilderann,&rdquo; commanded Trixie Bell,
insistently, &ldquo;go upstairs and sit with mother at once, and
tell her that Mr. Lancaster has called.&rdquo;&nbsp; The little
girl slid from the high stool again and disappeared
reluctantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Up the stairs, I said,&rdquo; remarked
Trixie, looking round the corner after her, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
ask you to wait on the second step listening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Bell returned demurely to the inner side of the
counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; she said, with an air of maturity,
&ldquo;want a lot of looking after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who looks after you?&rdquo; asked Bobbie, leaning over
the counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can take care of myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For one day, at any rate, I&rsquo;m going to take care
of you.&nbsp; Give me a kiss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bobbie!&nbsp; People can see through the shop
window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t give me a kiss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a time,&rdquo; said the pleasant-faced
young woman, with great <a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>preciseness, &ldquo;and a place for
everything, and this is neither the time nor&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>One advantage of being trained as a British sailor is that you
can vault over a counter and jump back again before anyone has
time to protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make me cross,&rdquo; said Trixie, with
great confusion and delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it back to me, then,&rdquo; suggested Robert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy I see myself doing that,&rdquo; said Trixie,
ironically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve fancied it a lot of times,&rdquo; remarked
Robert.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now it seems to me we&rsquo;ve arrived at
what you may call reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Trixie, leaning on the counter
and keeping one eye on the window, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t exactly
as though we were strangers, is it?&nbsp; What I mean to say is,
we&rsquo;ve known each other, Bobbie, for a long time, and
you&rsquo;ll be seventeen next birthday&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t argue,&rdquo; said Robert.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do
what I ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave to be a very little one,&rdquo;
said Miss Bell, seriously.&nbsp; And leaned forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Robert.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you must give up all this nonsense,&rdquo;
declared Trixie, with a sage air, and glancing at herself in the
panel looking-glass, &ldquo;and behave.&nbsp; Will you come
upstairs and see mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought p&rsquo;raps you and me might go out this
afternoon for a bit of a outing.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got to rejoin
my ship this evening, and I shan&rsquo;t have many chances of
seeing you when I&rsquo;m down at Plymouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in that,&rdquo; admitted
Trixie.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see if I can get a lady friend of
mine from Pitfield Street to look in for a few
hours.&rdquo;&nbsp; She raised her voice and called at the foot
of the stairs.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tilderann!&nbsp; Come down
this minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl obeyed, remarking in a grumbling undertone that the
place was a perfect treadmill, and that for her part she envied
the folk in Pentonville; she went to the doorway and reproved two
infants outside for breathing on the glass, in good, well-chosen,
and effective terms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put your arm round my waist, Bobbie,&rdquo;
whispered Trixie as they went up the dim, narrow staircase.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Besides, there&rsquo;s a buckle on my belt.&nbsp; Mother,
&rsquo;ere&rsquo;s a gentleman come to call on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Bell, raising her head from the white pillow, gave a
chuckle of recognition.&nbsp; Robert, with his cap off, made his
way round the bedstead, which seemed nearly to fill the room, but
not quite, and shook hands with the large invalid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor old &rsquo;ead,&rdquo; she remarked, jovially,
&ldquo;gets in such a fluster, sometimes, that I can&rsquo;t
remember nothing, and when the gel said Mr. Lancaster was in the
shop it took me minutes to think who she meant.&nbsp; D&rsquo;you
think Trixie&rsquo;s growed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Growed up and growed &rsquo;andsome,&rdquo; said
Robert.&nbsp; Mrs. Bell gave a sigh of content, closing her eyes
for a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;And how are you, ma&rsquo;am?&nbsp; On
the mend, I &rsquo;ope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bell, opening her eyes and
speaking loudly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got nothing to complain
of.&rdquo;&nbsp; She lowered her voice, and added confidentially,
so that Trixie should not hear, &ldquo;May pop off at any
moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>Trixie having explained the proposal that Robert had
made, suggested that she should go round now to engage the
services of the millinery friend in Pitfield Street.&nbsp; Her
mother agreed cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the old lady in a very loud
tone, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been used to a active life, and naturally
enough it goes somewhat against the grain for me to be kep&rsquo;
in one room for monce and monce.&nbsp; Otherwise I feel as
well&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Trixie went out of the room, closing the
door, and Mrs. Bell stopped and winked solemnly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;d never do to let her know the truth,&rdquo; she
whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I always like to pretend before her
I&rsquo;m getting better.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a rare game sometimes
the dodges I &rsquo;ave to get up to so that she shouldn&rsquo;t
know how bad I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trixie isn&rsquo;t a bad sort,&rdquo; remarked
Robert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s my daughter,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bell.</p>
<p>Before that excellent young lady returned poor Mrs. Bell and
Robert had a long, confidential talk.&nbsp; The cheerful old lady
regretted that her time had arrived before Trixie had become a
grown woman, but this regret was tempered by confidence in her
daughter, and by a promise which had been given by Miss
Threepenny to come and live with Trixie when all was over.&nbsp;
There breathed pride in the statement that her doctor from New
North Road could find no English name for her illness, and had
been compelled to fall back on the Latin tongue to give it title;
Mrs. Bell&rsquo;s old head trembled with gratification as she
told Robert of this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you mind &rsquo;olding my &rsquo;and,
Bobbie?&rdquo; she asked, interrupting herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
feel so much more contented somehow when someone&rsquo;s
&rsquo;olding me &rsquo;and.&nbsp; Thanks!&nbsp; As I was telling
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor had some time since recommended that she should be
taken away to the seaside, a procedure which might prolong her
life for a few months, but the old lady congratulated herself
upon having had the shrewdness to reply that Hoxton was as good a
place to die in as any other, and that she had not been saving
money all her life in order to spend it foolishly on herself at
the end.&nbsp; The good soul seemed quite happy; everybody, she
said, was very kind to her, and Trixie, who in former days had
been somewhat masterful towards her, now waited on her
&ldquo;hand and foot.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Bell declared that she
only wished everybody could be looked after at the end of all as
effectively.&nbsp; Trixie, returning with her substitute, came
upstairs in a hat which Robert, on being appealed to for an
opinion, declared looked like ten thousand a year, and they said
good-bye to Mrs. Bell, Trixie promising to send up
&rsquo;Tilderann and to return herself at the earliest possible
hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;urry,&rdquo; said the old
lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;And, Bobbie!&nbsp; Come back one moment.&nbsp;
Trixie, you go down.&rdquo;&nbsp; Robert obeyed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
shan&rsquo;t be seeing you again,&rdquo; said the old lady
brightly.&nbsp; &ldquo;If so be as I should meet your poor
mother, I shall tell her what a fine lad you&rsquo;ve growed
to.&rdquo;&nbsp; Robert bent and kissed the large white
face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be good, won&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; she whispered
brokenly, &ldquo;to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can make yourself quite sure about that,
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Robert.</p>
<p>Before going west on this sunny afternoon, the young lady
insisted that Robert should accompany her for a short tour
through certain streets in Hoxton, where her lady acquaintances
resided, which same young women <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>told each other afterwards that they
had not realized what the word pride really meant until seeing
Trixie with her young man.&nbsp; They looked at Ely Place from
the dwarf posts at the Kingsland Road end, where towzled-hair,
half-dressed, grubby babies played games with mud and swore at
one another, but the two agreed that they had no desire to go
through the Place.&nbsp; One more girl acquaintance in a Hoxton
street shop in whose sight Robert had to be paraded, and then the
two young people, walking down into Old Street, took a tram for
Bloomsbury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You pay for yourself,&rdquo; said Trixie Bell
definitely, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fear,&rdquo; protested Robert, &ldquo;I pay for both
to-day.&nbsp; This is my beanfeast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I go no further,&rdquo; declared the young
woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Agree to that, Bobbie, or down the steps I
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are obstinate,&rdquo; said Robert.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
never saw such a one for &rsquo;aving her own way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much use having anybody else&rsquo;s way,&rdquo;
she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bloomsbury, one,&rdquo; she said to the
conductor.</p>
<p>The principle thus definitely laid down being adhered to
during the afternoon, Robert found himself unable in consequence
to assume the air of condescension and patronage that he had
promised to wear; indeed, Miss Bell took the entire management of
the afternoon into her own hands, with a quaint air of decision
which surprised Robert and interested him, so that when at the
end of the tram line she said, &ldquo;Regent&rsquo;s Park,&rdquo;
it was to Regent&rsquo;s Park they went; on Robert in his
reckless way suggesting a &rsquo;bus, she said, &ldquo;Walk,
it&rsquo;s no distance,&rdquo; and that was the mode of transport
adopted.&nbsp; In Regent&rsquo;s Park they sat on chairs near to
sweet-smelling oval bouquets of flowers, watching the
white-sashed nursemaids and the children, and whilst Robert (to
Trixie&rsquo;s content) smoked a large, important cigar, she
chattered away about her plans for the future.&nbsp; Trixie
revived the old ambition of a milliner&rsquo;s establishment,
with French words in white letters on the window, in some
position not too far distant from Pimlico Walk, so that old
customers should be preserved, whilst new ones were being caught;
Robert watched her admiringly as she sketched this magnificent
project, noting the decision of her chin and the flush of
interest on her attractive face.&nbsp; The cigar finished, or
nearly finished (for Robert was not yet a confirmed smoker), they
walked arm-in-arm through the gates to the upper portion of the
park, where there were sheep to be looked at, and near to the
fountain, small debating societies, that seemed to grow on the
grass in the style of mushrooms, and were made up of grubby men,
arguing, as it seemed, on every topic of which they were
ignorant, with here a reference to John Stuart Mill, and there
satire at the expense of Apostles.&nbsp; Near to one of these
groups Robert and Trixie stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for your so-galled Queen, my goot Anglish
friends,&rdquo; a foreign gentleman with no collar shouted in the
centre of the mushroom, &ldquo;it don&rsquo;t dake me long times
to gif you my obinion about her and all her plooming
Gofernment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re beggin&rsquo; the question,&rdquo;
said his opponent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s keep to the point at
issue.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;ve ever read Plito, you would have been
aware that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not dalkin&rsquo; about Blato,&rdquo;
said the foreigner, with excited gesture.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
dalkin&rsquo; about the bresent day and the stupid, foolish idea
that you Anglish are a free nation.&nbsp; My obinion of your
Queen, my fellow, is simply these.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not quite clear what the foreign gentleman wanted to say, and
impossible to hear what he did say, for at that moment a sailor
lad edged his way through the crowd, two brown hands seized the
neck of his collarless shirt, and at once the two&mdash;Robert
and the foreign critic&mdash;were running away pell-mell to
Gloucester Gate, the foreigner forced to go at a good pace
despite his struggles, and being thrown eventually well into the
roadway outside the park.&nbsp; Robert returned to Trixie a
little heated with the run; Trixie&rsquo;s blue dotted blouse
danced with delight and admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll learn him,&rdquo; said Robert,
darkly.</p>
<p>In the Zoological Gardens they walked through the long house
where lions and tigers lodge, and Robert kissed Trixie in full
sight of a very sulky old lion, who had a bed-sitting room near
to the end, making the lion use an exclamation of annoyance and
envy that cannot well be printed.&nbsp; Then they went out into
the gardens to see long, thin, ridiculous legs with birds perched
riskily atop, and had a long conversation with one of the
highly-coloured parrots, who were all talking at once, and
seemed, like the debaters outside, to be denouncing somebody, and
in similarly raucous voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At tea, Bobbie,&rdquo; said Trixie, with a touch of her
decisive manner, &ldquo;I want to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been doing that the last hour or
two,&rdquo; he said, good temperedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but I mean seriously,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>At tea on the gravelled space near to the sleepy owls Robert
encountered friends whose presence deferred the weighty talk,
friends in the person of the angel from Folkestone, now clearly
Mrs. Customs Officer, her husband and a large-eyed astonished
baby in a white beef-eater hat.&nbsp; The angel came over from
her table on recognizing Robert and declared that the news of
this meeting would do poor uncle more good than all the
embrocation in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allow me,&rdquo; said Robert with importance, &ldquo;to
introduce my&rdquo;&mdash;he
coughed&mdash;&ldquo;<i>fianc&eacute;e</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trixie on this introduction assumed a distant manner, and sat
alone with a reticent air, while Robert went over to speak to
long Mr. Customs, and to dance the amazed infant high into the
air.&nbsp; The angel had grown very matronly; the Customs seemed
to be well under her control, insomuch that he never commenced a
sentence without finding himself instantly arrested and brushed
aside by his wife.&nbsp; On Robert rallying the angel on this,
the angel laughed good-humouredly, declaring that it was well for
one or the other to be master, and prophesying that some day
Robert would find this out for himself, whereupon Robert insisted
that women must not be too tyrannical, and endeavoured to enlist
the Customs on his side in the argument, but the Customs shook
his head vaguely (being it seemed with no grievance to complain
of), and begged not to be dragged into the discussion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What name was it you called me just now?&rdquo;
demanded Trixie, when <a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>he had returned to her.&nbsp; Robert
explained, and Trixie&rsquo;s young forehead cleared.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That reminds me,&rdquo; she said, resting one small shoe
on the bar of Robert&rsquo;s chair, &ldquo;I want to talk sense
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you,&rdquo; she said slowly and carefully,
&ldquo;to promise me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll promise anything you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To promise me that you&rsquo;ll give up all idea of
being a sailor, and take up some occupation on land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert shifted his chair and Trixie&rsquo;s foot slipped to
the gravel.&nbsp; He re-tied his lanyard with great
particularity, humming a tune.&nbsp; Trixie, fearful of the
reply, drew a heart with the ferrule of her parasol on the
gravel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not me!&rdquo; he said decidedly.</p>
<p>The heart on the gravel found itself rubbed out sharply and
rendered illegible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think it over, dear,&rdquo; said Trixie Bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t think it over,&rdquo; replied Robert
Lancaster sturdily.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;d be a mean trick to do
after all they&rsquo;ve spent on my training.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how it would affect them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to do it, Trixie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long as you earn a honest living&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; burst out Robert impetuously,
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t argue with girls.&nbsp; My mind&rsquo;s
quite made up, and I&rsquo;m not going to alter it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means, then,&rdquo; said Miss Bell, swallowing
something, &ldquo;that you don&rsquo;t care for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t mean anything of the kind,&rdquo;
protested Robert.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a question of
duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d easily get a good berth on shore,&rdquo;
she argued, &ldquo;and earn good money, and then we could see
each other pretty of&rsquo;en.&nbsp; As it is, I may not see you
from one year&rsquo;s end to the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absence makes the &rsquo;eart grow fonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the young woman pointedly, &ldquo;in
books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Robert, after a pause, &ldquo;now
that we&rsquo;ve cleared up this argument, &rsquo;ave some more
tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said Trixie with reserve.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I think I must be getting along &rsquo;ome.&nbsp; Looks as
though we shall &rsquo;ave a shower presently, I
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trixie,&rdquo; he said, trying to take her hand,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t be a young silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that complimentary remark,&rdquo; she said
rising, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s most certainly time for me to be
off.&nbsp; To be told in the Zoo above all places in the world
that I&rsquo;m a silly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say you was a silly,&rdquo; urged Robert
with great perturbation, &ldquo;I asked you not to go and be
one.&nbsp; Do stop, and let&rsquo;s be good friends the same
like&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was following the indignant young woman when the waiter
interposed, offering a delicate hint to the effect that his
services were usually deemed worthy of reward; by the time Robert
had found threepence Trixie had disappeared in the direction of
the camels.&nbsp; Other visitors watched the hurried distracted
efforts of the scarlet-faced sailor lad on his erratic voyage of
discovery with as much interest as though he had been an escaped
resident of the Gardens.</p>
<p><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>A
gloomy young man strode down Great Portland Street an hour later,
and, losing his way more than once, because he was too much
annoyed to speak to policemen, found himself at last in Holborn
and eventually in Fetter Lane.&nbsp; On the two middle-aged
ladies in the shop saying that Mr. Myddleton West was not in, and
had indeed removed, Robert, muttering that this was just like his
luck, turned away with a decision to return to Grays some two
hours earlier than he had intended.&nbsp; On board the
<i>Westmouth</i> one was at any rate free from illogical young
women; free also from the irritating risk of taking wrong
turnings.&nbsp; A swift hysterical shower of rain started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon, sir,&rdquo; he said gruffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My fault,&rdquo; remarked the man with whom he had come
in collision.&nbsp; &ldquo;I ought not to hold my open umbrella
in front of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. West, I believe, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young Hoxton!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look quite a man,&rdquo; said Myddleton West
genially.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come back to my office, and
talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look ten years younger, sir, than when I see you
last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ten years younger,&rdquo; said West.&nbsp;
&ldquo;On second thoughts we might eat.&nbsp; Do you feel like a
good square meal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m off me feed just for the present.&nbsp; Had
rather a whack in the eye this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only a prelude to good luck,&rdquo; said
Myddleton West, with new optimism.&nbsp; He seemed to be taking
cheerful views of the world; appeared brighter than in the old
days, and the lad felt inclined to resent it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Providence is very fair in a general way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning into a dim, insignificant passage off Fleet Street,
they found a doorway, as if by accident, which led them (also, as
it seemed, by a series of misadventures) to a square
old-fashioned dining-room of the early Victorian type.&nbsp;
Several men were seated at the wooden tables eating; two or three
Americans with note-books were being supplied by one of the old
waiters with a quantity of new and incorrect information about
the old eating-house, enlivened by rare anecdotes of
celebrities.&nbsp; In five minutes there was set before West and
Robert Lancaster a small mountain made up of admirable strata of
pigeons, of oysters, and of steak.&nbsp; Robert began by gazing
absently at the dish before him, and thinking about Trixie; the
smell of appetizing food changed his thoughts, and he presently
set to with admirable appetite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My great news can easily be told,&rdquo; said Myddleton
West across the table.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was married last
week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good business!&rdquo; remarked Robert.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who
is the lady, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is but one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought she&rsquo;d decided&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They never do that,&rdquo; remarked West.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She used to like talking about you, sir, to me when I
was in the hospital.&nbsp; I always thought it would &rsquo;appen
some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ordered out to some God-forsaken place in
Siberia,&rdquo; said Myddleton West.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are making
a new railway, and there&rsquo;s a lot of excitement, I
believe.&nbsp; Miss Margaret was good enough to insist upon
marrying me, before I went.&nbsp; When I come back my wife will
<a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>give up
her nursing business and we are going to settle down and enjoy
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good deal to be said for the old fashions,&rdquo; said
Robert wisely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Independence is all very well, but I
don&rsquo;t like to see it carried too far.&nbsp; Not with the
ladies at any rate,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me all about yourself,&rdquo; urged Myddleton
West.&nbsp; &ldquo;My wife will be anxious to hear.&nbsp; My
wife,&rdquo; West seemed proud to repeat these two words,
&ldquo;was always interested in you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert felt distinctly better when he had come out into Fleet
Street and had said a respectful good-bye to Myddleton West; this
partly because of the excellent meal and partly because of the
friendly chat.&nbsp; The shower had finished and he walked
East.&nbsp; Not until he had nearly reached Fenchurch Street,
with only five minutes to wait for his train, did he remember
that he had a high important grievance which careful attention
would, as he knew, nurture into lasting remorse.&nbsp; He went
slowly up the stairs of the station, and thinking with a desolate
sigh of women in general and of Miss Beatrice Bell in
particular.&nbsp; At the top of the staircase he caught sight
(his look being downcast) of Miss Threepenny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re a nice young gentleman,&rdquo; said
the little woman, satirically, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think.&nbsp;
Fancy coming to London and not waiting to see me.&nbsp;
This,&rdquo; added the mite, with a twinkle in her bright
bead-like eyes, &ldquo;is what you call constancy, I
s&rsquo;pose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no such thing as constancy,&rdquo;
growled Robert.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not in this world, at any
rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shows what you know about it,&rdquo; declared the
little woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come over &rsquo;ere; I&rsquo;ve a
friend I want to interduce you to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only got five minutes before my train
goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five minutes is ample.&nbsp; Come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the side of the bookstall Miss Threepenny convoyed Robert;
once in harbour there bade him on no account to stir, and puffing
off like a busy little tug to the waiting-room, returned
immediately with that trim yacht Trixie Bell in tow, whom she
also brought to anchor at the side of the bookstall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and see what platform your train starts
from,&rdquo; then cried the little tug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bobbie,&rdquo; said the well-appointed yacht,
penitently, to the man-of-war, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m
so sorry if I went and made myself look like a stupid this
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trixie,&rdquo; said the man-of-war, coming dangerously
close to the side of the neat craft, &ldquo;if anybody&rsquo;s to
blame, it&rsquo;s me.&nbsp; Only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall quarrel again, dear,&rdquo; said Trixie Bell,
sedately, &ldquo;if you talk like that.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re quite
right in what you&rsquo;ve made up your mind to do, and I respect
you all the more for it, and if you&rsquo;re away ten seconds, or
if you&rsquo;re away ten years, I shall always be the same
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man-of-war saluted with so much promptitude that a
newspaper boy in the bookstall, safe in ambush behind an
illustrated journal, made ventriloquial comment.&nbsp; Miss
Threepenny hurried up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now run, Bobbie,&rdquo; said the tiny woman,
breathlessly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll just catch it,
and&mdash;good luck to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He caught the train as it moved out of the station and jumped
into a <a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>third-class compartment.&nbsp; When he had regained his
breath he leaned his bare head delightedly out of the window to
enjoy the cool air that had come after the shower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; he said, to Stepney Station, with
some astonishment, &ldquo;I begin to think that I don&rsquo;t
half understand women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this remark it will be seen that Robert Lancaster,
formerly child of the State, and shortly to enter the service of
his great parent, was now no longer very young.&nbsp; Wherefore
it is here that one may prepare to take leave of him.</p>

118</span>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> new shop which bore the name of
Miss Beatrice Bell stood so far up the Kingsland Road, beyond the
canal, that you might have said it was in Dalston, and none would
have dared offer contradiction.&nbsp; A happy situation, in that
the shop found itself able to at once keep touch with the
superior classes of Hoxton and with the middle classes of
Dalston; a distinction being made in the two windows, so that
Hoxton lady clients on entering turned instinctively to the left
counter, whilst those from Dalston turned to the right.&nbsp;
Beatrice Bell, grown to a tall, self-possessed young woman, still
in slight mourning for her mother, had the nightly companionship
of little Miss Threepenny, and assistance by day from the perky
&rsquo;Tilderann, whose enthusiasm for the business was equalled
by her intolerance of anything likely to interfere with
achievement of these ends; her mistress&rsquo;s habit of buying
evening newspapers whenever the placards shouted anything about
the Delar expedition, of making customers wait while she read the
telegraphic accounts nervously, constituted a weakness that made
&rsquo;Tilderann groan.&nbsp; But for these occasional lapses
Beatrice Bell had become a shrewd, business-like woman, not only
reaching the high standard set by her assistant, but sometimes
exceeding it, and extorting from that young woman gracious
compliment.&nbsp; It was indeed worth watching to see and hear
Miss Bell deal with some lady of Hoxton who having ideas of her
own in regard to a new hat, insisted upon explaining them in
detail.&nbsp; The young proprietress of the establishment would
listen with perfect calm whilst the client described the kind of
hat which represented her heart&rsquo;s desire; when she had
finished, Miss Bell would say icily, &ldquo;I quite understand
what you mean, but,&rdquo; here a slight shrug of the shoulders,
&ldquo;they are no longer worn.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon which the lady
customer could only ejaculate a confused and abashed
&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; and request that something that was being worn
should be taken from the window and exhibited to her.</p>
<p>Beatrice Bell, her hands clasped behind her, taking the air at
the doorway of her shop, and bowing to acquaintances in the swift
crowd of young women hurrying northward to their tea, glanced up
and down the busy road with its sailing trams and jerking
&rsquo;buses.&nbsp; The hour was seven; the sky still light with
a juvenile moon that seemed, with the impatience of youth, to
have come out too early.&nbsp; Dashing young blades of
shopkeepers also taking the air at their doorways, caught sight
of the white-speckled blouse, and bowed to her, and noting with
pain her distant acknowledgment, declared to each other that Miss
Bell would stand an <a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>infinitely better chance of getting
married were she less reserved in manner, a drawback which had
already cheated her of more than one invitation to Epping Forest
on early-closing day.&nbsp; &ldquo;For,&rdquo; said Mr. Libbis,
the tobacconist, to his friend at the second-hand shop,
&ldquo;she may be as &rsquo;aughty as she likes, but after all,
mind you, she&rsquo;s only a girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Opposite, a boy pasted on the boards outside the newspaper
shop a new placard: &ldquo;Brave conduct at Delar.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She ran across the road to buy a copy of the newspaper; before
she returned a customer came to the Hoxton side of the shop
demanding something stylish at one-and-eleven.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tilderann fenced with her pending the return of her
mistress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It occurred to me, looking in the glass,&rdquo; said
the woman confidentially, &ldquo;that I wanted smartenin&rsquo;
up.&nbsp; It may be only me fancy, but it struck me I was
beginning to look old.&nbsp; What d&rsquo;you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depends what you call old,&rdquo; replied
&rsquo;Tilderann.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sure you can&rsquo;t run to more
than one-and-eleven?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight year ago, or a trifle more,&rdquo; said the
woman, reminiscently, &ldquo;I was as light-&rsquo;earted a young
woman as you&rsquo;d &rsquo;ave found in all &rsquo;Oxton, if
you&rsquo;d searched for a month.&nbsp; I was really the rarest
one for making jokes that you ever &rsquo;eard of before my
&rsquo;usband, Bat Miller, had to go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emigrated?&rdquo; asked &rsquo;Tilderann, glancing
between the hats and bonnets for her mistress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He were away,&rdquo; said Mrs. Miller, evasively,
&ldquo;for a matter of four or five year.&nbsp; And when I went
to meet him, believe me or not, he was as stand-offish in his
manner as he could he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s like &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said
&rsquo;Tilderann.&nbsp; &ldquo;These bonnets at four-and-three
are all the go just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite &rsquo;igh and mighty if you please,&rdquo; went
on Mrs. Miller aggrievedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I firmly believe
that if I hadn&rsquo;t had on my best mantle he&rsquo;d have gone
off again, goodness knows where.&nbsp; As it was, I persuaded him
to settle down, and we&rsquo;ve got on as well as can be
expected; only that now and again, when we have a few words, he
says something very satirical about the old days in Ely
Place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here she is!&rdquo; said &rsquo;Tilderann.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come on, Miss!&nbsp; &rsquo;Ere&rsquo;s a customer been
waiting for howers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; remarked Beatrice Bell, panting.&nbsp;
Her pretty face was crimson with excitement; she hugged a pink
halfpenny journal to her breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something at about one-and-eleven, Miss,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Miller respectfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not too quiet and not too
loud, and something that&rsquo;ll suit my features.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Bell, trembling oddly, went up the wooden steps and
brought down a box containing black hats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything special, Miss, in the evening paper?&rdquo;
asked Mrs. Bat Miller ingratiatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Beatrice, panting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I of&rsquo;en &rsquo;ave a look at the
playcards,&rdquo; said Mrs. Miller; &ldquo;they give me about as
much information as I want.&nbsp; Are these the newest shape in
this box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the corner of the box,&rdquo; said Miss Bell,
endeavouring to regain her usual composure.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll tell you, &lsquo;Chapeaux de
Paris.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>&ldquo;Sounds all right,&rdquo; agreed Mrs.
Miller.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was saying to your young lady here that
I&rsquo;ve been making up my mind to take more trouble about me
personal appearance.&nbsp; Otherwise, it&rsquo;s likely enough
Miller&rsquo;ll be getting tired of me again, and then
there&rsquo;ll be more trouble.&nbsp; How would you advise me to
have this trimmed, Miss, if it isn&rsquo;t troubling you too
much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beatrice Bell gave advice in a hurried way as though pressed
with more urgent affairs, and anxious to see her customer
depart.&nbsp; Mrs. Miller did go, after reciting some more of her
personal history; when she had gone Miss Bell took the evening
paper from her waistbelt and sat down behind the counter.&nbsp;
She had scarcely done so when the bell of the door rang and a
tall young woman came in, dressed in a tailor-made costume, which
caused &rsquo;Tilderann to gasp with admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you,&rdquo; she said pleasantly to that amazed
girl, &ldquo;give the driver this half-crown and tell him not to
wait?&rdquo;&nbsp; She turned brightly to the young
proprietress.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are Miss Bell, are you not?&nbsp;
My name is Mrs. Myddleton West.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; said Miss Bell trembling,
&ldquo;till the girl comes back, and we&rsquo;ll go into the shop
parlour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have read the evening paper I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it certainly, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;
replied the agitated young woman, &ldquo;but as to reading it,
why my eyes get so full the moment I begin that I can&rsquo;t get
on with it very fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a letter from my dear husband,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Myddleton West proudly, &ldquo;from my dear husband giving fuller
particulars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve come straight here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tilderann returning, flushed with victory because she
had compounded with the cabman for two shillings and two pence,
and therefore able to refund the sum of fourpence, was commanded
to look after the shop, and Miss Bell conducted her visitor into
the small room at the back.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tilderann, noting with
regret that the door closed carefully, found compensation in
serving across the counter imaginary bonnets to imaginary wives
of society millionaires at the price of fifty guineas per
bonnet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this Robert Lancaster?&rdquo; asked Mrs. West in her
pleasant way.&nbsp; She took up a photograph of a brown-faced
sailor lad, clean shaven, with a humorous mouth and bare
neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my Bobbie,&rdquo; said Beatrice Bell with
pride.&nbsp; &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you take the easy chair,
ma&rsquo;am?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been quite a lovely summer,
hasn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; I suppose we shall soon have autumn upon
us if we&rsquo;re not careful, and&mdash;Oh,&rdquo; she cried,
interrupting herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is the use of me
pretending to be calm when I&rsquo;m all of a tremble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you must sit down,&rdquo; this with a kindly
authoritativeness, &ldquo;sit down here close to me, and I am
going to read to you the letter from my husband, which arrived
only this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Delar?&rdquo; asked the girl, seating herself
obediently on a hassock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Delar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could you let your husband go away,
ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can,&rdquo; said Mrs. West,
&ldquo;again.&rdquo;&nbsp; She found the letter and took the thin
sheets carefully from the envelope.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I felt that
I ought not to be selfish all through my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you the sister who looked after Bobbie in
the hospital, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. West nodded and
smoothed out the sheets of note paper.&nbsp; <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>&ldquo;I
wasn&rsquo;t quite sure whether Mr. West wouldn&rsquo;t go and
marry some one else, considering&mdash;I s&rsquo;pose I&rsquo;ve
no business to say so&mdash;but considering the way you kept
putting him off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took care,&rdquo; said Mrs. Myddleton West quickly,
&ldquo;that he should not do anything so absurd.&nbsp; Shall I
begin the letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Beatrice Bell,
looking up respectfully.&nbsp; Mrs. Myddleton West commenced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest, ever dearest,&rdquo; she stopped.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I need trouble you with the first page
at all,&rdquo; she said with some confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you mean, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; Start where he
begins to speak of Bobbie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It appeared that Bobbie came in about the middle of the second
sheet.&nbsp; The war correspondent out at Delar had intuitively
written on one side of the paper only, and Trixie Bell noted this
deplorable want of economy, but West&rsquo;s small handwriting
managed to convey a good long letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember our young friend Bobbie Lancaster.&nbsp;
The lad, now a sailor attached to H.M.S. <i>Pompous</i>, is on
the launch where I am writing, and he did this afternoon an act
of quiet bravery which ought, I think, to make his country feel
that the trouble it took to make a man of him was not
wasted.&nbsp; I am sending an account of the incident to my
journal by the post which takes this letter to you, but you will
care to have fuller particulars.&nbsp; How I wish that the mail
were also taking me to the arms&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Mrs. West, &ldquo;is, of course,
merely by the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skip a few lines,&rdquo; suggested Trixie, her chin
resting upon her hands, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t leave out more
than you&rsquo;re obliged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trail of the story was re-discovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But touching Lancaster!&nbsp; We left H.M.S.
<i>Pompous</i> and steamed up a broad smelly river, bordered by
mangrove trees with long weeping branches, and approached the
town of Delar.&nbsp; Delar is nothing like a town, but a mere
collection of whitewashed huts around a large circular hut, where
that genial person, the king of Delar, has hitherto lived.&nbsp;
It was in this central hut that he caused to be massacred the
Englishmen who, at his request, came some months since to confer
with him on the subject of trade; our expedition is, as you know,
intended to prove to him that such tactics are not only
unbusinesslike, but positively rude.&nbsp; This lesson will be
taught him by our marines when they land to-morrow, and I have
little doubt but that they will do it effectively.&nbsp; I was
talking to the Intelligence Officer when Lancaster came up
hurriedly, and, saluting, said that the Admiral wished to see the
other officer at once.&nbsp; The Intelligence man hurried below,
and Lancaster and I had two minutes&rsquo; chat.&nbsp; He has
grown a fine strong fellow, with honesty in both eyes, and
muscular arms tattooed with the word
&lsquo;Trix.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dear boy!&rdquo; burst out Miss Bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We talked of the old days, and he said that he only
cared to think of Hoxton now because his sweetheart lived
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might read that part again, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He talked of the old days, and he said that he only
cared to think of Hoxton now because his sweetheart lived
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl gasped.</p>
<p><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>&ldquo;Fancy his talking about me,&rdquo; she said
delightedly, &ldquo;all that distance off.&nbsp; Go on,
ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whilst we were talking, commotion began on shore.&nbsp;
Men were running up and down; boats were launched, the
Intelligence Officer and the Admiral, escorted by four marines
and four sailors, prepared to leave.&nbsp; Some whistling and
giving of orders; the steamer slowed and stopped.&nbsp; The
Admiral, I may tell you, is a big-bearded fellow, daring, and
very popular with the officers and the men, but on board the
<i>Pompous</i>, just before we left, there had been general
agreement that he had done a risky and almost a foolhardy thing
in agreeing to a palaver with some of the king&rsquo;s
supporters.&nbsp; The officers knew that his idea was to punish
the king and the king only; whereas the officers desired to
punish everybody.&nbsp; If you had seen the mutilated body of an
English gentleman bound upon what is called a crucifixion tree
near the king&rsquo;s hut, I think, dear, you would have agreed
with the officers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not being allowed to go on shore, I give most of the
rest as recounted to me by my friend the Intelligence
Officer.&nbsp; The Admiral and his escort descended into the
boats and were rowed ashore by the natives; Robert Lancaster was
one of the bluejackets.&nbsp; At the shore they were received
with great courtesy by the king&rsquo;s chief ministers; the
king, as we knew, had scuttled off inland on receiving news of
our approach.&nbsp; With exceeding ceremony the Admiral and his
escort found themselves conducted to the king&rsquo;s compound,
the while on the launch our Maxim stood ready to rake the town on
the least sign of treachery.&nbsp; At each door of the
king&rsquo;s house lay a woman&rsquo;s dead body.&nbsp; This, it
was explained, had been done to prevent the arrival of the
English; a precaution on the part of the king that had proved
singularly unsuccessful.&nbsp; In the palaver house, a long
half-roofed building with a bronze serpent at the entrance, and
inside, seats of dry red mud, the Admiral took up position, and
through the interpreter addressed the chiefs; Robert Lancaster
being, as I am told, one of the men stationed behind the Admiral
and his officers.&nbsp; Standing at a rough table the Admiral
said that the great White Queen was angry because of the infamous
massacre of her children; as a good mother she had determined to
avenge their murder.&nbsp; But though the great White Queen was
powerful, she was also just, she wished to punish only those
responsible.&nbsp; Wherefore the king was to be pursued and
captured and dealt with severely, but those of the natives who
were friendly would not be hurt, and would, indeed, be under
British protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am now,&rdquo; said young Mrs. Myddleton West
gravely, &ldquo;coming to the very serious part of the
letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I hold your &rsquo;and, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; asked
the girl.&nbsp; For answer she found her right hand taken
instantly with a quiet matronly manner that gave her
confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the Admiral spoke and the interpreter repeated each
sentence, the ministers listened with attention and with plain
signs of agreement.&nbsp; The younger men rose from the red mud
seats and pressed forward.&nbsp; They began to speak confusedly;
the Admiral held up his hand for order.&nbsp; One of the younger
men smashed a square of looking-glass on the floor; at the same
moment Robert Lancaster flung himself suddenly on a muscular
black youth who had risen from the ground close to the Admiral,
unseen by others of the escort.&nbsp; The blade intended for the
Admiral&rsquo;s back caught in <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>the fleshy part of Lancaster&rsquo;s
arm; a swift struggle ensued between the two before the others
realized what was happening.&nbsp; A sharp revolver shot from one
of the officers settled the murderous young black; Lancaster
sucked at his own wound, spat, stepped calmly back to his
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now!&rdquo; protested the wife of Myddleton West,
breaking off tearfully, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t cry,
dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; sobbed Miss Bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The others shared his composure; the Admiral himself
never lost self-possession for a moment.&nbsp; He concluded the
palaver as though nothing of moment had happened; went out of the
house with his escort and down to the shore and
re-embarked.&nbsp; Arrived here on the launch, the Admiral sent
for Bobbie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What is your name, my lad?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Robert Lancaster, sir, of the
<i>Pompous</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Are you hurt, much?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nothing to brag about, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you know that you saved my life?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; said Bobbie with great
respect, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not sorry to have paid back a bit of
what I owe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. West,&rsquo; remarked the Admiral, turning
to me, &lsquo;let the English people know something about
this.&nbsp; I will look after the lad, but you, too, can do
something.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doctor tells me that the blade was poisoned at the
tip&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beatrice Bell&rsquo;s hand tightened her hold, and the white
speckled blouse stilled for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that Lancaster&rsquo;s smartness and resource alone
saved the wound from becoming dangerous.&nbsp; Lancaster wants
you to call on his sweetheart and tell her all about it, because
for a few weeks he will not be able to write.&nbsp; I shall be
home, my dearest, in less than a month, and when I see
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all about Bobbie,&rdquo; said Mrs. Myddleton
West, stopping.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you think of it all,
dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could no more,&rdquo; declared Miss Bell,
&ldquo;explain to you what I think, ma&rsquo;am, than I could
fly.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m too thankful to talk much.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
girl looked wistfully at the sheets of rustling note paper.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d think I&rsquo;d got impudence,&rdquo; she said
hesitatingly, &ldquo;if I told you, though, what I&rsquo;ve got
in my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I was just thinkin&rsquo; how annoyed you&rsquo;d
be if I was to ask you to give me the part that
concerns&mdash;that concerns my Bobbie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Far from showing annoyance, Mrs. West cheerfully ordered the
production of scissors; &rsquo;Tilderann being called, responded
so promptly that suspicious persons might have guessed she had
become tired of serving imaginary customers, and had been trying
to listen at the doorway.&nbsp; Having brought the scissors,
&rsquo;Tilderann was sent back again to look after the
shop.&nbsp; Then the two women bent their heads near to each
other, and dividing the letter carefully, judiciously, and very
lovingly, the shares were allotted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. West rising, &ldquo;come and
see me at the address on this envelope to-morrow evening, and let
us talk it all over quietly.&nbsp; Come to dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; asked the astonished girl.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Me at dinner in Kensington?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I insist upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a good talker,&rdquo; stammered Miss Bell,
&ldquo;in&mdash;in an ord&rsquo;nary way, but just now&mdash;I
only wish my friend Miss Threepenny was here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A call from &rsquo;Tilderann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But some day me and Bobbie will be able to tell you how
much&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; She bent her head to her friend&rsquo;s
hand impulsively.&nbsp; Young Mrs. West kissed her on the
cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lot of use anybody bawling &lsquo;Shop,&rsquo;&rdquo;
said &rsquo;Tilderann at the doorway ironically, &ldquo;when no
one don&rsquo;t take no notice.&nbsp; Why, you&rsquo;re
crying!&nbsp; Whatever&rsquo;s the matter, Miss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matter?&rdquo; repeated Miss Beatrice Bell with
indignation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you think I should cry if there was
anything really the matter?&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
